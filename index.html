							<h3>January 25, 2024</h3>
							<p>Walking into LA, I knew that there would be economically polarized sectors throughout the city. I’ve seen the glamor of Hollywood, Berkeley Hills, and universities in LA, but only in video. I’ve also seen the less fortunate, also only in video. I’ve read about Little Tokyo, and how you should stay clear from 3rd Avenue and beyond, though that was on Reddit. And who believes Reddit anyways? I walked carefree through San Pedro Street with the intention of getting to the Fashion District, passing 1st Avenue, then 2nd Avenue, then 3rd. The streets were getting dirtier and there were more wanderers as we walked on. 4th, 5th, and it kept getting worse. The buildings were run down, and there were wanderers and screamers. The wanderers were harmless, I knew; they are just like me, I knew. But by 6th Avenue, I didn’t want to go to the Fashion District anymore. Flies, the stench of urine, and catcalls filled the air. This was not the LA that I had imagined even though I had seen the very images of desperation and destitution. I hated myself for forgetting that Reddit post.</p>
							<p>But actually, walking in that neighborhood in LA was pretty necessary for me. I experienced sympathy, but never understood what it was like to fear every second of your life–and not only life, but matters much worse. I have had the privilege of being an outsider and perhaps worse, of being ignorant.</p>
							<p>I cried a good amount in the shower that day (the privilege of having a shower is so real), not sure whether it was of happiness or sadness. It wasn’t really either, but maybe it doesn’t matter. A lot of those people are waiting for a change that may never be delivered. A lot of people don’t even know what they're waiting for, or that they’re waiting. They can’t exactly walk out so easily like I did, because I have the security of returning to a home. I’m afraid that I’ve already fallen ignorant again, as I nestle in the comfortable nooks of the very coat that I wore that same day.</p>
							<p>I wonder if this polarization is inevitable in big cities. Is it human nature to keep striving forward, forgetting the ones who lie on the sidelines? People either have dreams, or they don’t. Or more accurately, people either have defined dreams, or they don’t. And I wonder if this will get worse through the advancement of AI, because a lot of people are going to get laid off. Even with defined dreams, they don’t always work out because of social, political, or economical factors.</p>
							<p>I used to use privilege to guilt-trip myself into working harder, but this method didn’t work well because it was built off pleasure. On the other hand, being grateful is recognizing the pains that we have faced in life, and that they were necessary. I read somewhere about the pain and pleasure principle, which is that humans (and possibly animals? I don’t remember if it extended to other living things) tend to base their decisions off avoiding pain rather than gaining pleasure. Gratefulness isn’t typically associated with negative emotions, but it inherently acknowledges that the present could be worse. And maybe that’s why it’s so effective.</p>

							<h3>December 31, 2023</h3>
							<p><i>…and with that, the 2023 season comes to an end!</i></p>
							<p>At the start of this year, I said that I would be a more confident person. That is a pretty vague goal, and I thought that a lot of what I wrote still applied. But I watched a video of myself explaining a math problem from around a year or two ago and… it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I had wanted to watch this video for a while but could predict my pain before even opening the link. I’m not sure if my somewhat-positive perception is because I’ve grown to be more accepting of myself, or because the video itself really was not that bad–though the use of filler words and randomly chuckling from nervousness every five seconds was not it.</p>
							<p>But I’d say that in general, I’m more confident in talking to more people! I think part of this was because I was half-forced to, and also because more of my classes this year have been a different mix of people. Also, being more involved in different positions plus teaching more has also helped a ton. Now my challenge is how to come up with something to say quickly, because a lot of the time, I sit there in silence, trying to formulate the perfect thought to say, but the wave of conversation has already passed. Improv classes were supposed to help, except when I stopped taking them, I kinda made teaching more formulaic. I prefer predictability, which is easier to do with teaching–not so much with conversation.</p>
							<p>We'll leave that up to 2024 me.</p>

							<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
								Recent developments:
							</p>
							<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
								<ol>
									<li>Deciding against getting a premium account on Spotify for at least three times within the last month alone because the price was not justifiable enough to categorize it as a non-compulsive purchase (all in hopes of not disappointing the financial literacy teacher :”) ).</li>
									<li>I decided to wait out on buying a NYT subscription for some reason, and procrastinated on it for so long that someone else actually figured out that inputting our school email gives us a subscribed account for free. On a similar note, I also procrastinated on purchasing jewelry-making tools and yarn, and I ended up getting the former as a Thanksgiving present, and the latter as a Christmas present, both of which were from the same friend!</li>
									<li>Learned how to ice skate! My fall rate reduced from 17 falls/hr to 6 falls/hr, and somehow this is the most I’ve been injured??</li>
									<li>Passed 100,000 words in my journal! To be fair, the journal was made a year and a half ago, but still. Once my fingers start flying, they won’t stop.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							
							<p>And with that, happy new year!</p>

							<h3>December 21, 2023</h3>
							<p>Welcome! If you’re here from Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), you’ve come to the right place for my posts! If you’re not, I originally had my blog on AoPS, but have migrated here because I wanted to try branching out to my own website. This isn’t technically my own site (as in my own domain), but this site feels a lot more customized than on the AoPS interface. I still have a few things I would like to work on:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>This might be picky of me, but the muffin logo on the index page… it is not as centered as I would like it to be. I don’t know why it won’t move up, but honestly, the muffin is probably the least urgent of what I want to work on. It would be nicer if it was bigger and moved up a bit.</li>
								<li>The subscribe form is currently an embedded Google form, but I would like to have a subscribe form built into the site.</li>
								<li>Interactives! I really want to code games and other bits into the site just so things are a bit more interesting. Maybe like a randomized Mad Libs, etc.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>plus more things as they come up.</p>
							<p>On the topic of what I’ll probably be learning in 2024, I learned a lot this year and a lot has changed. Namely, apparently I’m not as much of an introvert that I used to be? I used to get 97% or higher percentages on the introverted end unironically, but now I’m a bit more even. I definitely do enjoy being around people a lot more than I used to and feel more fulfilled from talking to people. I still kinda self-deprecate myself over the smallest of interactions or the smallest of anything, which I’m still working on not doing as much.</p>
							<p>On a related note, I’ve also learned that no one is obligated to do anything for you, nor are you obligated to do anything for anyone. I find that the former is much more important to realize than the latter, because it made me a lot less dependent on external validation. I used to overthink over a lot more interactions just because someone didn’t react in the exact way I expected them to. And apparently–somehow I only just realized this–people didn’t react at all to what I was saying because I simply don’t speak loudly or enunciate my words clearly enough. I can hear myself just fine, but obviously, the outsider perspective is very different. I’ve been told by a lot of people that I have a softer, whispery voice, which used to not be true. So perhaps I shall tune into a loudspeaker. The latter (that I’m not obligated to do anything for others) is important too, but I didn’t find the need to exercise that belief very much.</p>
							<p>I also have been more accepting of letting go of whatever is out of my control. There have been so many instances in which something didn’t work out the way that I wanted it to, but later, it was good that the particular event didn’t work out. If it had worked out, in the long term, it would’ve fallen apart because it was 1. Not the right timing, as in I wasn’t prepared for it and 2. It’s not the last time I get that opportunity anyway, so why be upset. I should actually be comforted about how life works out even if it doesn’t align with the plan that I have. After all, life would be super boring if I knew the entire plot.</p>
							<p>So for 2024, we’ll all have a mind map of what we want to do! But let us not be too surprised if we stray off our path, for that was meant to happen. Whatever is meant for you will come to you. Isn’t the thought of that comforting?</p>

For the sake of brevity, I'll introduce myself as mouffin, though I admit that I do enjoy the protection of extra anonymity.</p>
								<p>Perhaps I'm known as a fervent boba milk tea advocate, who happens to enjoy crocheting on the side; or a feeble one to the spiciest of foods, like those seasoned with black pepper; or a chemistry student who <i>allegedly</i> poisoned a batch of muffins with a slip of the hand. But I'm also an individual video producer, armed with an iPhone 12 mini, Adobe Premiere Pro, and a ton of ambition; or a STEM enthusiast still undecided on what math/science to pursue; or as you may meet me here, a blogger who loves to overthink.</p>
