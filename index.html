								<h4>No, this isn't about the 2008 financial crisis</h4>
								<h3>April 13, 2024</h3>
								<p>We’ve reached <c href="#" data-tip="This number will update, so if you know me personally and agree, lmk lol">two</c> on the counter for people who’ve told me that I’m vulnerable on this blog, which is really interesting to me because I don’t think I’m being very vulnerable at all. Yes, these thoughts are pretty raw, so I could see that. But if anything, I don’t really open up about my struggles written here with friends. Some of my friends do read these posts, and would probably know more about my struggles from here than from in-person or online interactions. I don’t know why, but I feel a pressing guilt whenever I complain. It feels inherently wrong, like I don’t deserve to experience frustration, even though this isn’t true. Generally, I don’t like complaining unless it’s a shared complaint with the person I’m talking to or if it’s to the point that I physically cannot take it anymore. Even with the latter, usually the vent ends with one of the following: “It’ll be fine,” “I’ll cope,” or “Eh, I’ve got it.”</p>
								<p>The strange part is I don’t mind if people around me complain; I just don’t like myself doing it. If anything, I would feel terrible if I knew I could’ve helped someone by letting them vent to me. Of course, I have boundaries, like please do not turn every conversation into something about <c href="#" data-tip="Clearly I've had this experience">how your shoes have tripped you again because the shoelaces are poorly-designed</c>. But where my boundary is the strongest is what I am <c href="#" data-tip="Is complaining a right to be earned?">"allowed"</c> to say.</p>
								<p><c href="#" data-tip="A made up term, loosely defined as the situation in which one avoids complaining">Complaint-avoidance</c> isn’t a bad thing, but it’s a double-edged sword, as it calls to the half-full, half-empty glass idea. Seeing a half-full glass is fine and dandy until you’re disillusioning yourself into seeing a glass full when there isn’t even a drop in it.</p>
								<p>And that’s when the bubble bursts. Or when the beaker breaks, <c href="#" data-tip="But bubble sounds nicer... maybe glass bubbles?">to align with the glass analogy</c>. To repress the moments in which one cannot take it anymore, or to gaslight oneself into thinking that things are fine. I think the main purpose of this post is to show people who know me maybe more on the surface-level that what I portray on the outside is absolutely not indicative that I’m on top of things all the time. There are times that I break. Yet, there’s this expectation I have out of myself that I have to somehow <c href="#" data-tip="'Do it for my homegrown's (sisters, brothers) / Do it for the clan'">stay strong for everyone else for some reason</c>, which could perpetuate the image that “I’m on top of things all the time.”</p>
								<p>It’s funny I say all this and still perceive some friends who have everything together, even though that’s not realistic and places them on a pedestal rather than as a friend.</p>

								<h3>March 30, 2024</h3>
								<p>What is the meaning of life? My take is that life is about learning how to be happy sustainably. Not about being happy, necessarily, but learning how to be. In learning how to be happy, that doesn’t mean to be happy all the time, because things happen. Happiness is also a metric that is measured differently depending on the person. Like personally, I really <i>really</i> hate bugs, but someone else could derive their happiness from studying bugs their whole life! The fact that we all have our passions and hobbies is so cool.</p>
								<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s head back to the definition. I haven’t explained “sustainably,” yet it is a crucial part of the definition. There are many ways one can be happy in a way that is disingenuine or that masks a root cause of unhappiness, rendering the happiness temporary. However, the boundary between what is sustainable versus what is unsustainable is a gray area too. Happiness naturally waxes and wanes, so is there ever sustained happiness? How long does happiness have to last for a certain technique to be deemed “sustainable”?</p>
								<p>I think the metric of what is sustainable also depends on the person. For me, sustainability is also about its repeatability and its after-effects, along with whether the overall action <c href="#" data-tip="Why is this starting to sound like Effective Altruism... this was not the goal">results in a net positive</c>. We shouldn’t feel taxed in the long-term to make up for the short-term either, and of course we shouldn’t create our happiness at the cost of others. Hence, I like to look at life through a half-full glass. We know so little about each other’s lives and intentions, so it doesn’t make sense to impose a bias behind someone’s actions. There’s this quote I saw in someone’s bio, which goes, “Be kind, especially when we don’t know what’s going on.” Even though someone could be annoying/[insert other similar adjectives] on the surface, sometimes that’s how they are, and they aren’t intending to tick other people off.</p>
								<p>Of course, there are times when this half-full glass view of life was problematic. It is slightly reminiscent of toxic positivity. Indeed, there have been times when I looked past people who… well, may not have had the best intentions. This is when I kinda depend on my friends to see the situation at face value. An example of this is not of a person, but of an unscheduled <c href="#" data-tip="There's this security system at our school for when there's an active shooter on campus, and what happens is that all the doors automatically lock, including this massive garage door that normally never closes. Then a looped audio of our school's security guy plays, telling everyone to hide in a corner. It's meant to be pretty scary.">drill</c> during finals week around two years ago: when everyone else was panicking, I assumed that there was a drill and tried to convince others that this was the case. At the time, no one knew whether the drill was real, but I was living peacefully, which, in retrospect (in lack of a better, not as harsh term), was pretty stupid.</p>
								<p>Otherwise, seeing life through a half-full glass has worked pretty well. I like to think that when we look around, everyone and everything is a reflection of ourselves. People will mirror your energy, which is why some people say that “life is what you make it to be.” We shape the people who are around us, and we mimic the people who are around us.</p>
								<p>Happiness is a choice we can make, and we all have it in us to push through and make that choice, no matter how hard it may be.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">People are cool</h2>
								<h4>(if you aren’t afraid of them)</h4>
								<h3>March 25, 2024</h3>
								<p>One of the first ways I introduced myself here was how I used to score 97% introvert on the 16 Personalities test. While I still consistently test as INTJ-T (Architect), I score around <c href="#" data-tip="That is, a 60%... which is supposed to be good.">a D- on the introvert scale</c> now. You might think, “Oh, scoring an A+ on the introvert scale? Well, surely there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert!” Scoring an A+ on the introvert scale is literally a diagnosis for <c href="#" data-tip="Not that there's anything wrong with being a hermit, of course. Hermit crabs are cool.">a hermit</c>.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
									Allow me to enlighten you with what life was like as an A+ introvert through snippets of my journal:
								</p>
								<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
									<ol>
										<li>“When we were introducing ourselves, my heart was beating so fast when the person before me was going, and now my lips are uncontrollably shaking unless if I force a smile.” -7/28/22</li>
										<li>“It’s too bad that I didn’t talk to him very much or catch up with him and I probably will never see him again so here I am with a nice existential crisis [about how I could’ve simply said hi], but oh well.” -1/10/23</li>
										<li>“At the end, [the instructor] made the two quietest people on each team to make our points, and I was one of them because. Oops. I don’t really talk.” -8/28/23</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>Anytime there was some sort of event that involved people I wasn’t familiar with, I didn’t want to go. In eighth grade and most of freshman year, I didn’t really talk to anyone new. I always talked to the same people–not that talking to old friends is bad or anything, but the underlying problem was staying in my comfort zone, during which I wasn’t happy anyway.</p>
								<p>Looking back, <c href="#" data-tip="There is probably a better term for this, but I define 'introvertism' as the practice of being an extreme introvert.">introvertism</c> was the cause of many of my problems. One of the problems was making friends/socializing with unfamiliar people, which requires practice. But introvertism inherently results in intentionally avoiding people to not talk to them because of the fear that this new environment would turn around and judge us. Laugh at us. But this was all in my head because <c href="#" data-tip="Sure, there are exceptions, but if someone truly judges/laughs at you, then they have showed you who they are. Also, worrying about the judgement/laughter is your own voice. You worry about judgement/laughter from yourself, not necessarily that of others.">no one actually does that</c>. And not talking to people would only enhance this fear because I never built up the skills to talk to people, which led to nitpicky comparisons and lost opportunities.</p>
								<p>It’s not just about lost opportunities. Talking to people builds up the ability to… judge? Interrogate? Conjecture? All those words are <c href="#" data-tip="Not me just talking about how people don't inherently judge/laugh at others like, three lines ago?? But this is more of... a protective thing?">too strong</c>, but the idea here is that talking to people allows us to better gauge who someone is. And, well. Speaking from personal experience, that is pretty important.</p>
								<p>One of the lessons that I wish I thought about more earlier is people are not out to get you. This may be feeding into a naive view of always looking at the glass half-full, but this could also be from self-love and the belief that you are already worthy of surrounding yourself with good people. I believe that most people genuinely wish the best for others, and are willing to help. I found that I became happier the more I talked to people. I also don’t judge myself as I did before, and carry myself with just a little more authenticity and confidence. There’s no way of winning in overthinking. With overthinking, there’s this “heads I win, tails you lose” mentality. I still remember talking to people online at first, who are good friends now. The caret blinks, expecting my words to flow, but it waits and stares back at me. With every keystroke, I worry that the sentences won’t come out right, or that they weren’t clever enough. But why mask who I was to start if people were going to find out who I was anyway? The only way is to just write.</p>
								<p>That is not to say that I have no fear in talking to new people or that I’m a newfound extrovert. But there’s a little comfort in knowing that merely existing is okay and good enough, and that <c href="#" data-tip="That's the title of this post!!!">people are cool if you aren’t afraid of them</c>. If there was one thing that I could tell myself, it would be that she’s already good enough and doesn’t need to prove herself to anyone. The fear of not being good enough wasn’t an effective method to push her into being better, and instead, it restricted her in what she could’ve been. Alternatively, I wouldn’t have told her anything. Talking to people was something she had to find out for herself.</p>

							<article id="Happy_Pi_Day">
								<h2 class="major">Happy π Day!</h2>
								<h3>March 14, 2024</h3>
								<p>At the time of writing this, if we combine the month, day, and hour, we get 3/14/15 → 3.1415 ≈ π. Unfortunately, we are merely in the year 2024 (68 more years until ‘92!), and there are only 60 minutes in an hour, so we can’t go much further with this pi representation.</p>
								<p>But we can go further with spirit! Specifically, I had the honor of leading Pi Day at my school, which was, of course, much more difficult than I predicted. To be fair, this was the first event I ever led at our school, and there were only four members in our committee for a school-wide event. A lot of the time, life felt like the bridge that was built under a poor approximation of π (ok I could not actually find this story, so maybe it’s imaginary). Initially, I was pretty self-critical about how this event was run and wasn’t happy with how it went, but a lot of people said it was good?? And I can’t help but immediately think, “Oh, these people are just being polite. Of course they can’t say that it <i>wasn't</i> run well.” But it also feels wrong to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwUEPryqmw">reject the compliment right away</a>. At least when I give a compliment, I’m not just trying to be polite, so why would I assume that about others?</p>
								<p>Anyways, this post wasn’t supposed to get so philosophical so quickly. bUt PhIlOsOpHy Is IntErEsTiNg!!! Pi Day itself had a few new events, but it also retained past events. Knowing that there were previous events as comparison was kiiinda nervewracking. At some point during my first class, I had a moment in which I couldn’t “breathe too heavily or there’s something sharp in my chest kinda feeling.” The immune system or whatever was triggering that… she was working a bit overtime! There were multiple past 12am-ers and many journal entries screaming “AAAAA,” but things worked out in the end. I could focus on the mistakes, but that would probably be boring to read and are probably nit-picky anyways. All the mistakes funnily worked out too, so… yay?</p>
								<p>Another interesting point was that someone said that I sounded really confident when public speaking, which challenged my perception because that’s not a trait I associate myself with. I wouldn’t say that I’m confident, but I would say that I’m good at forcing myself to do something when it has to be done. The confidence came out because I had no other option, and it was as if it was a survival response.</p>
								<p>Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from this (and I realize this is probably super obvious, which I learned after running the event) is that being a leader isn’t about how hardworking you are. It’s about how well you communicate and coordinate with other people. There is no way to be in five different places at once. If there was, I absolutely would have, but that’s not how the world works. Obviously being hardworking and motivated is a prerequisite to running an event well, but without people, there is no catalyst. So the people I have to thank the most are the people who helped out with the event <s>as they helped balance out my incompetence at times</s>. All the people who did science demos, pie deliverers, pie distributors, the setup and cleanup crew, staff, the Pi Day committee, and of course, the student body for their unwavering patience.</p>
								<p>As to not get flagged for a ChatGPT-esque ending, this sentence will be the last sentence instead. Happy pi(e) day!</p>

							<article id="Existential_Crisis_1">
							<h2 class="major">Existential Crisis #1</h2>
							<h3>February 20, 2024</h3>
							<p>I say #1, because this probably will not be the last time that I think of using a similar title. Also, partly because I’m having an existential crisis on how to title this amalgamation of thoughts.</p>
							<p>Recently, I’ve felt empty, like a hollow shell without a why. As I’m filling out applications, I feel like I should know what to do with my life, or that I should have known long ago. Some of what I do is not because I love it, but because I don’t know where else to go, and I can tolerate it for the time being. Only this year did I realize this was actually a really big problem. Why would any sane person spend their life doing something that they’re tolerant of when life offers a multitude of fulfillment?</p>
							<p>I think this was the question that started it all:</p>
							<blockquote>What would you do if there were no external expectations? Would your path, your destination, your ambition change?</blockquote>
							<p>I always knew I would want to do STEM, but did I really choose it? I enjoy it now, but even then, my parents chose it for me because they wouldn’t be able to help with humanities-related subjects. They could at least give me the foundation in STEM. I didn’t resist it enough to twist my path around–there were fights about doing more IXL (which I do not regret) or working on more competition math problems, but so what? Was I about to become a writer or historian instead?</p>
							<p>Fortunately, I can say that I do like STEM without being forced into it now, but I would have trouble explaining why I enjoy it. “It’s cool. Thinking about it makes more sense, and I’m okay at it. I can help people in it, because I have the knowledge to. The community makes me feel like I belong somewhere, and I feel like I have a greater impact in it than if I chose humanities.” I would always run into an explanation that was either too general or tied to societal expectations.</p>
							<p>Instead, I turned to a comfort: video production. Nobody ever told me to go into video production, and I can’t remember how it started. Only then, my dad has encouraged me to continue pursuing it, not only because I’m passionate about it, but also because not many people turn to it as a hobby. At the same time, my mom criticizes it. “Do not listen to your father. It’s not something that’ll be useful to you later on. You do not have time to ‘pursue hobbies’ when there are other urgent tasks. And you can always turn to this later, once you settle at college.” Deep down, I know that video production would not be my career, but at the most, a part-time job. I knew my mom was right as much as I wanted to follow my dad’s advice.</p>
							<p>Coming from a household that heavily emphasizes the importance of standardized test scores, I realize that the problem of feeling empty is an incredibly privileged problem to have, which has, ironically, contributed to the emptiness; with people suffering much more, it feels wrong to admit my problems. I understand my parents, because they worked their way out through taking tests (competing against many kids who, quite literally, had their dad donate a building to an institution) or climbing up the grueling economic ladder. At the same time, it feels wrong to commit to some standardized tests or a value out of four. I think, <i>This is a different country,</i> and that’s why our values are different. But is our country really any different? Not having a “good” test score isn’t the end of the world, but it sure helps.</p>
							<p>It’s probably okay to not know what to do right now, but it still feels intrinsically wrong. I think the root of this problem is feeling frustration behind the college application process, and hearing endless echoes in the walls screaming, “Help yourself first because you turn around and the people you help aren’t obligated to help you back in the first place,” even though it goes against my principles. I’ll keep reflecting back, “These feelings are temporary, and we’ll do with what we have,” screaming it until I believe.</p>

						<article id="Privilege">
							<h2 class="major">Privilege</h2>
							<h3>January 25, 2024</h3>
							<p>Walking into LA, I knew that there would be economically polarized sectors throughout the city. I’ve seen the glamor of Hollywood, Berkeley Hills, and universities in LA, but only in video. I’ve also seen the less fortunate, also only in video. I’ve read about Little Tokyo, and how you should stay clear from 3rd Avenue and beyond, though that was on Reddit. And who believes Reddit anyways? I walked carefree through San Pedro Street with the intention of getting to the Fashion District, passing 1st Avenue, then 2nd Avenue, then 3rd. The streets were getting dirtier and there were more wanderers as we walked on. 4th, 5th, and it kept getting worse. The buildings were run down, and there were wanderers and screamers. The wanderers were harmless, I knew; they are just like me, I knew. But by 6th Avenue, I didn’t want to go to the Fashion District anymore. Flies, the stench of urine, and catcalls filled the air. This was not the LA that I had imagined even though I had seen the very images of desperation and destitution. I hated myself for forgetting that Reddit post.</p>
							<p>But actually, walking in that neighborhood in LA was pretty necessary for me. I experienced sympathy, but never understood what it was like to fear every second of your life–and not only life, but matters much worse. I have had the privilege of being an outsider and perhaps worse, of being ignorant.</p>
							<p>I cried a good amount in the shower that day (the privilege of having a shower is so real), not sure whether it was of happiness or sadness. It wasn’t really either, but maybe it doesn’t matter. A lot of those people are waiting for a change that may never be delivered. A lot of people don’t even know what they're waiting for, or that they’re waiting. They can’t exactly walk out so easily like I did, because I have the security of returning to a home. I’m afraid that I’ve already fallen ignorant again, as I nestle in the comfortable nooks of the very coat that I wore that same day.</p>
							<p>I wonder if this polarization is inevitable in big cities. Is it human nature to keep striving forward, forgetting the ones who lie on the sidelines? People either have dreams, or they don’t. Or more accurately, people either have defined dreams, or they don’t. And I wonder if this will get worse through the advancement of AI, because a lot of people are going to get laid off. Even with defined dreams, they don’t always work out because of social, political, or economical factors.</p>
							<p>I used to use privilege to guilt-trip myself into working harder, but this method didn’t work well because it was built off pleasure. On the other hand, being grateful is recognizing the pains that we have faced in life, and that they were necessary. I read somewhere about the pain and pleasure principle, which is that humans (and possibly animals? I don’t remember if it extended to other living things) tend to base their decisions off avoiding pain rather than gaining pleasure. Gratefulness isn’t typically associated with negative emotions, but it inherently acknowledges that the present could be worse. And maybe that’s why it’s so effective.</p>

							<h3>December 31, 2023</h3>
							<p><i>…and with that, the 2023 season comes to an end!</i></p>
							<p>At the start of this year, I said that I would be a more confident person. That is a pretty vague goal, and I thought that a lot of what I wrote still applied. But I watched a video of myself explaining a math problem from around a year or two ago and… it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I had wanted to watch this video for a while but could predict my pain before even opening the link. I’m not sure if my somewhat-positive perception is because I’ve grown to be more accepting of myself, or because the video itself really was not that bad–though the use of filler words and randomly chuckling from nervousness every five seconds was not it.</p>
							<p>But I’d say that in general, I’m more confident in talking to more people! I think part of this was because I was half-forced to, and also because more of my classes this year have been a different mix of people. Also, being more involved in different positions plus teaching more has also helped a ton. Now my challenge is how to come up with something to say quickly, because a lot of the time, I sit there in silence, trying to formulate the perfect thought to say, but the wave of conversation has already passed. Improv classes were supposed to help, except when I stopped taking them, I kinda made teaching more formulaic. I prefer predictability, which is easier to do with teaching–not so much with conversation.</p>
							<p>We'll leave that up to 2024 me.</p>

							<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
								<ol>
									<li>Deciding against getting a premium account on Spotify for at least three times within the last month alone because the price was not justifiable enough to categorize it as a non-compulsive purchase (all in hopes of not disappointing the financial literacy teacher :”) ).</li>
									<li>I decided to wait out on buying a NYT subscription for some reason, and procrastinated on it for so long that someone else actually figured out that inputting our school email gives us a subscribed account for free. On a similar note, I also procrastinated on purchasing jewelry-making tools and yarn, and I ended up getting the former as a Thanksgiving present, and the latter as a Christmas present, both of which were from the same friend!</li>

							<h3>December 21, 2023</h3>
							<p>Welcome! If you’re here from Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), you’ve come to the right place for my posts! If you’re not, I originally had my blog on AoPS, but have migrated here because I wanted to try branching out to my own website. This isn’t technically my own site (as in my own domain), but this site feels a lot more customized than on the AoPS interface. I still have a few things I would like to work on:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>This might be picky of me, but the muffin logo on the index page… it is not as centered as I would like it to be. I don’t know why it won’t move up, but honestly, the muffin is probably the least urgent of what I want to work on. It would be nicer if it was bigger and moved up a bit.</li>
								<li>The subscribe form is currently an embedded Google form, but I would like to have a subscribe form built into the site.</li>
								<li>Interactives! I really want to code games and other bits into the site just so things are a bit more interesting. Maybe like a randomized Mad Libs, etc.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>plus more things as they come up.</p>
							<p>On the topic of what I’ll probably be learning in 2024, I learned a lot this year and a lot has changed. Namely, apparently I’m not as much of an introvert that I used to be? I used to get 97% or higher percentages on the introverted end unironically, but now I’m a bit more even. I definitely do enjoy being around people a lot more than I used to and feel more fulfilled from talking to people. I still kinda self-deprecate myself over the smallest of interactions or the smallest of anything, which I’m still working on not doing as much.</p>
							<p>On a related note, I’ve also learned that no one is obligated to do anything for you, nor are you obligated to do anything for anyone. I find that the former is much more important to realize than the latter, because it made me a lot less dependent on external validation. I used to overthink over a lot more interactions just because someone didn’t react in the exact way I expected them to. And apparently–somehow I only just realized this–people didn’t react at all to what I was saying because I simply don’t speak loudly or enunciate my words clearly enough. I can hear myself just fine, but obviously, the outsider perspective is very different. I’ve been told by a lot of people that I have a softer, whispery voice, which used to not be true. So perhaps I shall tune into a loudspeaker. The latter (that I’m not obligated to do anything for others) is important too, but I didn’t find the need to exercise that belief very much.</p>
							<p>I also have been more accepting of letting go of whatever is out of my control. There have been so many instances in which something didn’t work out the way that I wanted it to, but later, it was good that the particular event didn’t work out. If it had worked out, in the long term, it would’ve fallen apart because it was 1. Not the right timing, as in I wasn’t prepared for it and 2. It’s not the last time I get that opportunity anyway, so why be upset. I should actually be comforted about how life works out even if it doesn’t align with the plan that I have. After all, life would be super boring if I knew the entire plot.</p>
							<p>So for 2024, we’ll all have a mind map of what we want to do! But let us not be too surprised if we stray off our path, for that was meant to happen. Whatever is meant for you will come to you. Isn’t the thought of that comforting?</p>

								<p>Hey there! I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FantasticSky">Fantastic Sky</a>, <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/427430">Muffin_Potato</a>, or mouffin depending on where you find me. For the sake of brevity, I'll introduce myself as mouffin, though I admit that I do enjoy the protection of extra anonymity.</p>
								<p>Perhaps I'm known as a fervent boba milk tea advocate, who happens to enjoy crocheting on the side; or a feeble one to the spiciest of foods, like those seasoned with black pepper; or a chemistry student who <i>allegedly</i> poisoned a batch of muffins with a slip of the hand. But I'm also an individual video producer, armed with an iPhone 12 mini, Adobe Premiere Pro, and a ton of ambition; or a STEM enthusiast still undecided on what math/science to pursue; or as you may meet me here, a blogger who loves to overthink.</p>
								<p>I will be posting essays, rants, and all the different varieties of word soup <a href="#posts">here</a>, so if that’s your jam, welcome!</p>
