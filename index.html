								<p>Hey there! I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FantasticSky">Fantastic Sky</a>, <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/427430">Muffin_Potato</a>, or mouffin depending on where you find me. For the sake of brevity, I'll introduce myself as mouffin.</p>
								<p>Perhaps I'm known as a fervent boba milk tea advocate, who happens to enjoy crocheting on the side; or a feeble one to the spiciest of foods, like those seasoned with black pepper; or an instructor/officer of varying flavors, trying to make the world a better place. But I'm also an individual video producer, armed with an iPhone 12 mini, Adobe Premiere Pro, and a ton of ambition; or a STEM enthusiast eager to figure out how people work through a combination of math and biology; or as you may meet me here, a blogger who loves to overthink and yap.</p>

								<p>This is my red Raytheon water bottle, which I hold quite dear to me. It’s adorned with stickers, dented thoroughly, and most importantly, stolen over a hundred times. I got it from MathCounts Nationals in the year that it was held online. I still remember finding out about qualifying for it—I was in the middle of art class over Zoom, when I suddenly itched to check MathCounts State results on AoPS. I didn’t expect anything, because I didn’t remember doing particularly well, but on the screen, it flashed, <i>“Congratulations! You are invited…”</i> and my heart jumped. There was no need for me to read further. I could not believe it, and for the next five minutes, I had to force my poker face and act as if I was pondering my next muse.</p>
								<p>I used to insist that the water bottle must remain in its sleek, untainted, clean form. It was like a trophy that I held dear to my heart. For about a year, I restrained myself from adding a sticker before I thought that it was silly to not use my massive stash of stickers.</p>
								<p>And thus, it began.</p>

								<p>A massive, loaf-like cat. I figured that this sticker was acceptable because 1. It’s predominantly red, and 2. It’s a cat.</p>
								<p>But oh! Next came the pride frog, which was too cute not to include. There’s a lovely cat bookstore in our town called The Radical Cat, which is where I got this sticker from. The frog is simply so hoppy and <c href="#" data-tip="Both meanings here">gay</c>, and the pastel colors are lovely. Also, I am an ally.</p>
								<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">And the rest of the larger stickers all hold a story of their own:</p>
								<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
									<ol>
										<li>Totoro: One of my friends, <b>Horse trumpet</b>, who is also <c href="#" data-tip="Ah... story for later">one of the kleptomaniacs</c>, did as a kleptomaniac would, which was to steal my water bottle. Upon examining this sticker, he misidentifies Totoro as a rat, starts humming Africa, and it takes me much too long to <c href="#" data-tip="Toto ≈ Totoro">get the joke</c>.</li>
										<li>Te odio: Another one of my friends, <b>Metostatis</b>, who is quite unsurprisingly, also one of the kleptomaniacs, was quite insistent on owning a piece of real estate on my water bottle, which was to add a giant sticker with a baby on it. Now, I must say that a giant sticker with a baby on it did not fit in with the other stickers I owned. For most of junior year, <b>Metostatis</b>'s only objective was to get the sticker on there, because it was also like a trophy to him—apparently, he had won it in an intense game among his Spanish classmates. Perhaps now is also a good time to mention that I have nearly no knowledge of Spanish.</li>
										<li>Chicken: A third friend and kleptomaniac here, <b>Preminger</b>, drew this one! She had a chicken sticker series and actually started with a sheep sticker series. I still have a lot of these that I have yet to use, because real estate is getting a little tight. A sheep has yet to make its way there though.</li>
										<li>Cherry or bird: A mishmash between a cherry and a bird, which is <c href="#" data-tip="One day, I must explain neutrosophy in a blog post">another story on its own</c>. But besides that, I love that every time I lift my water bottle to drink water, anyone who looks over will see this beauty.</li>
										<li>Other features: <c href="#" data-tip="with a very anatomically accurate brain">Science</c>, <c href="#" data-tip="It was especially motivating during finals season last year">You goat this!</c>, too small of a  <c href="#" data-tip="another hyperfixation among friends, for some reason">Hello Kitty</c>, <c href="#" data-tip="both of which are fun stickers I got at a sale hosted by Crafting Club at our school">Bread I really like bread, and Octopus army</c>.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								
								<h3>The memory that is left</h3>
								<p>Every time I feel someone brush past me on my left, or even approach me from the left, my instinct is to defend my water bottle, whether it's still there or already stolen. Most of the time, I’m right, but there have been times when I mistake a thievery about to take place when it’s really just someone trying to get by. I mean, out of the 173 people at our school, I can currently think of 11 kleptomaniacs. On some days, my water bottle is more likely to be with someone else than with me.</p>
								<p>I don’t know why my water bottle specifically, though I do know that red is quite eye-catching. Perhaps it’s my dramatic reaction every time it’s taken away—I do have to admit that it’s funny to witness this hyperfixation. That’s the thing about friendly thievery: the object is stolen long enough to make you aware that it’s missing, but there’s also enough balance between suspense and safety that there’s a mutual understanding that it’ll return eventually to its rightful owner.</p>
								<p>I still remember when my water bottle was stolen by <b>Snapper</b> for so long that I had to resort to my Thermos lid to collect water. Or when <b>Heliscone</b> returned with its handle missing, which was how I learned that the handles were <c href="#" data-tip="On a later day, I find a handle sitting on the stairs at the entrance of our school. Heliscone has the exact same water bottle as me. The handle was not mine.">removable</c>. Or during walks to Advanced Chemistry Lab—and at this point, Advanced Biology Lab as well—I’d be an outsider to a hot potato game with my water bottle.</p>
								<p>Strangely, I do feel like this water bottle built a sense of community. I met each of the kleptomaniacs individually, yet we all vaguely know each other now. Because the kleptomaniacs are aware of each other’s existence, they have planned more elaborate pranks. Yes, there are some kind souls who try to restore peace and order within the chaos. Once, I mistook <b>Irina</b>’s attempt to fix the position of my water bottle as a thievery attempt. Then again, I would’ve never expected to have caught <b>cinnoia</b> red-handed, since he was one of the peace-restorers for some time. Shenanigans do bring people together.</p>
								<p>I must admit, it’s really nice to have friends carry it sometimes. It lifts a weight off my shoulders.</p>

								<p>I’ve been listening to classical music a lot recently, which has pulled me back to my roots. Piano was my earliest devotion—starting at the age of five, I would bang on the keys of our upright piano, unknowingly developing perfect pitch. I’ve done mostly solo repertoire since then, but I’m surprised that I’ve never encountered Debussy’s <i>Images</i> until recently.</p>
								<p>Actually, I encountered the second piece of the series, “<c href="#" data-tip="A tribute to Rameau, another French composer. Debussy commented on Rameau's concerts, stating that he 'seems to be our contemporary.' Otherwise, they didn't seem to encounter each other much">Hommage à Rameau</c>,” while listening to the soundtrack for <c href="#" data-tip="A lovely game about causing chaos as a goose—I have yet to play the game in full, but I love its minimalistic art style and storybuilding. And oh, of course, the soundtrack as well!">Untitled Goose Game</c> during the pandemic. I didn’t think much of it then, except “this game automatically earns some cool points for incorporation of Debussy pieces” and “learning ‘Minstrels’ just because it’s from the game <c href="#" data-tip="I did end up learning this piece, because I liked the mischievous and playful tone portrayed through its dissonances and rhythm. It differed from pieces that I normally gravitate towards, which are either 1. fast-paced and technical or 2. slower and romantic, filled with pretty chord and arpeggios.">would be funny</c>.”</p>
								<p>But my second encounter was quite recent, while I was randomly flipping through a piano encyclopedia book. I found the first piece of the series, “<c href="#" data-tip="A piece about reflections in the water. I tend to love pieces that are inspired by this image">Reflets dans l'eau</c>,” and loved the contrast between its gentleness at the beginning of the piece and the buildup to the climactic part in the middle, and back again to tenderness. It reminds me of ocean waves.</p>
								<p>Naturally, I looked into the third piece, and funnily enough, it’s called “Mouvement,” just like the name of this blog. <c href="#" data-tip="I think not!">Coincidence?</c></p>
								
								<h3>“Are you… happy?”</h3>
								<p>September 5, 2019. 5 years ago, I wrote a letter to myself a year in the future. I was the quintessential tween: boiling over with angst, worrying about public perception, and attempting to build my identity. Every <c href="#" data-tip="or half year, if I was extremely impatient">year</c>, I’d ask a variation of that question and receive some sort of cryptic answer, like “Aha, <i>but what is happiness?</i>” or a grounded “Nope! Well, surely next year will be better.” Even though those years were hard, I was <c href="#" data-tip="The reason for (?) is because I'm not sure about this adverb in the context of how I feel about optimism, which I'll expand on later">strangely (?)</c> optimistic in these reflections, which has expanded to being optimistic over everything across time.</p>
								<p>But I’ve learned that I also need to be careful about being optimistic, because it sometimes lends to an unrealistic outlook on life. I liked to think that everyone acts for the benefit of others. You could say that I approached reality in a dream state.</p>
								<p>Ironically, many people say that I write things as they are, as opposed to encoding my thoughts in beautiful metaphors. Rather than the typical live in reality and write in story, I live in story and write in reality.</p>
								<p>Maybe it’s why I write these blog posts.</p>

								<h3>“I am.”</h3>
								<p>I was exploring some buildings on the university campus near our school recently, and as I was wandering to the library, turning over recent frustrations and small wins, I realized that <i>I was happy</i>. In “Reflets dans l'eau,” Debussy composed a piece about the reflections of water. The reflection is a warped perception of reality—the image is distorted across the water’s surface, the hallmark of an impressionistic painting. And while reflections can be beautiful, it simply isn’t reality.</p>
								<p>I realized that I was looking at life through its reflections, rather than what it was. In turning over frustrations, I found that holding a grudge on a person, or trying to weakly justify why someone is acting this way wasn’t as relevant as figuring out how to move on and improve the situation, at least in the acceptance stage. I do think that having a healthy way to regulate emotions and figuring out why someone is acting a certain way are important. But in acceptance, it’s about less talking and more doing.</p>
								
								<h3>It’s such a beautiful day…</h3>
								<p>In Don Hertzfeldt’s film <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i>, it explores a stick figure named Bill, who experiences worsening dementia. At first, he goes through his monotonous routine, but gradually develops flashes of colorful images, which are a construction of his past. But is it his past? And is what he is experiencing real? I haven’t actually watched the film, but the idea is I do not want to have a confabulated version of a person or a situation just because I judged something too quickly.</p>
								<p>I used to trash the university campus near our school, but I actually hadn’t seen much of it. While exploring the buildings, I couldn’t help but stop every few steps, because it was <i>beautiful</i>.</p>

								<h3>August 25, 2024</h3>
								<p>Merriam-Webster defines “desiderium” as “an ardent desire or longing … especially [as] a feeling of loss or grief for something lost.” I invited <b>ellipsis</b>, who is a super person I met at a summer camp. Sometime during the last half of camp, I randomly asked her to write about anything she wanted. Our essays should have had a high probability of not overlapping with one another, though in retrospect, perhaps the consequence of when I asked was that we had anticipated feeling desiderium. What brought the essays together was the longing of experiencing a memory again, as unattainable as we knew that would be.</p>
								<p>Word soup is a dish that brings people together–and so now, I serve you a lovely collection of essays. Bon appétit!</p>

								<p>As I descended the stairs of my school after this year’s orientation, I remembered that I could skip down two stairs at a time. Suddenly, I was brought back to the Marciano dining hall stairs, its surface glistening with who knows what mysterious liquid was spilled, upside down chocolate cupcakes that <c href="#" data-tip="They should’ve competed in the 2024 Paris Olympics">performed a somersault</c>, and bustling BU students transported into another world through their Apple devices. The image came so abruptly that I zoned out and nearly pulled a +1 on the trip counter. It would’ve been a core memory to plummet in front of all the rising juniors and seniors, and I realize that I need to be more careful–not of embarrassing myself, but of uncontrolled flashbacks.</p>

								<p>I worry that I’ll be searching for these past memories in present moments, clinging to a comfort long gone. Is it any good to base people or places off previous data points? Two houses on my street become my temporary summer homes: one abandoned house that was newly remodeled held a beautiful view of the city, unobstructed by trees; the other which burned down from a fire a year ago, its fluffy insulation still exposed in broad daylight. They’re reminders of the places The Sanest Madmen have gone: the 17th floor of the CDS offering views of gorgeous sunsets and Boston at night; the basement of the GSU, which we affectionately called “asbestos land” for its poster on the front door.</p>
								<p>As for people, a new friend picks apart ideas like <b>ellipsis</b> once did to me and holds the same fascination for exploring new music like <b>StratfordJames</b>'s willingness to let me indoctrinate him into soft pop and Studio Ghibli music. I used to be afraid of talking to him because he questioned everything that was uttered when we took physics together two years ago, and I realized how fearful I was of being wrong or looking funny then. Not just over two years–I’m sure that I changed within six weeks at camp, but I’m not exactly sure in what way. Only my friends and family back home will see the shift.</p>

								<p>Funnily enough, I used this song as background music for an Instagram story before camp. But I think it’s more applicable for coming back, because I too, <c href="#" data-tip="Foreshadowing for the next essay, perhaps!">fear forgetting</c>. I tend to remember events through pictures–I need some sort of cue to stimulate my brain, which is why if I don’t take a picture of something, it’ll probably be lost to the wind. My camera roll is the reality I construct.</p>

								<p>I scroll through the thousands of photos and videos accumulated over six weeks, and I realize that I am dangerously using my camera roll as an escape. I know that watching us chairing in GSU or playing in the park at the Charles Esplanade will make me happy, but there’s that pang of tartness in my heart as the video finishes. I live through the videos–soon, my memory will be constructed merely through visual and auditory senses, not of the emotions in that moment, nor of other senses, like touch or smell. The complexities will slowly slip away. I remember now–isn’t smell supposed to be what brings you back to a memory?</p>
								<p>But even then, I am a video producer. Eventually, I’ll have to face the task of constructing a summary of these memories. But nothing, <i>nothing</i> will ever compare to the moment itself. The video <c href="#" data-tip="Not to mention that some files were lossy, which essentially is a permanent loss of original data due to data compression">fails to capture nuances</c> and richness of the memory. I worry that in cutting down on content, I’ll remember the watered-down version too, and then my memories are merely a museum, becoming an empty hallway without a cue.</p>
								<p>Nonetheless, I’m grateful to have these memories, because they’re proof that life does get better. I can trigger happiness through a photo or video irrespective of the fact that it’s an altered version of the original memory. No matter what, the memories will all be altered in some way, so why worry?</p>
								<p>But really, I need to be careful when descending the stairs next time. They were steeper than I remember.</p>
								
								<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;" id="i_miss_you_more_than_i_remember_you"><c href="#" data-tip="quote from On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong">i miss you more than i remember you</c></h3>
								<p><i>by ellipsis</i></p>
								<p>Time is relative, but the six weeks of summer burn too quickly. There is something bittersweet about existing in moments that will pass into memories.</p>
								<p>My friends sometimes marvel at my memory. Or rather, they marvel at my crystalline descriptions of past experiences. I have come to notice that a small sliver of my memories exists in eidetic scenes, like a hologram, or the Live Photo function on an iPhone. In between busy days, flashes of the past would come back: the angle of a slight smile, the glint of a streetlight on glasses, or the melody of a forgotten piece. Memories of faces or places sometimes superimpose, trapping me in a time loop. <c href="#" data-tip="morning instructor">Ryan</c> said that people with eidetic memory remember things too clearly, and all their pain never fades. To a small degree, I know exactly what he means. </p>
								<p>And so, I joke that I am afraid of remembering. The sharp clarity of some memories comes at a cost: a wave of nostalgia or an unwanted ache. Ryan also said the feeling of nostalgia closely resembles one of both joy and disgust. Perhaps joy from the bleeding sunset and golden rays. But disgust too, at the unshakeable thought that perhaps we were never meant to be more than another body heat on a cold lonesome journey. Perhaps we were condemned to fade in each other’s memory. </p>

								<p>In reality, I am more afraid of forgetting. I live with the fear that moments will disintegrate between my fingers as time marches on. As I fly across the world to <c href="#" data-tip="Boston to Hong Kong, 12 hrs ahead of EST">another time and place</c>, I amuse myself by conjuring snippets of this summer camp. I remember my shoelace dangling off the dorm rooftop, flailing in the wind. I remember holding my breath through a plume of smoke while dashing back for midnight curfew. I remember the faint lightheadedness of playing Ondine upside down on an abandoned piano. I tell myself that I will remember this summer. But what I mean is that I will miss this summer painfully.</p>
								<p>I landed at the Hong Kong Airport 16 hours later, thoroughly disoriented and disheveled, like I just woke up from a dream. On the <c href="#" data-tip="a metro line that goes to and from the airport">Airport Express</c>, I rifle through the photos of <c href="#" data-tip="gc name">the sanest madmen</c>, scrolling through <c href="#" data-tip="eheh marauders reference">the countless mischiefs we’ve managed together</c>. With a stab of panic, I felt as though <c href="#" data-tip="I hear people’s texts in their voices">the sound of their laughter was already slipping away</c>. And worse, this is not something that can be taxidermied in a photo on my phone.</p>
								<p>But apparently memory is an illusion: we only remember the last time we remembered, and never the event itself. Perhaps this is why my kleptomania flares when I leave somewhere I won’t return to, an itch for something to curl my fingers around. When my memory fades, how would I know that the past I yearn for really existed? </p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><b><i>An afterthought</i></b></p>
								<p>Perhaps we meant to only exist in moments: a burst of laughter by the riverside wind, a fluttering pulse under a cold fingertip, a last warm hug with tears held back. </p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_1">1. In the end, everything is going to be okay.</h3>
								<p>Move-in day was swarmed with anticipation and anxiety of what was to come in the next six weeks. What would the dorms be like? Who would I meet? How would I make the most of this experience? At this point, I had already been in Boston for two days, but I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to call it home for the next six weeks.</p>
								<p>At the time, a lot of my friends were in the area, but at different camps/occupations. I had a sense of security that if all really went wrong, I had people to fall back on. But it was also rather symbolic that they were all in Cambridge–separated by the Charles River, I couldn’t call them my lifeline. I had to break from the cocoon and fend for myself if it came down to that.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Lesson_2">2. The people are irreplaceable.</h3>
								<p>And therefore, it’s important to put yourself out there, especially in the first few days. Go to every social event that’s provided, because everyone else is looking for friends. Whenever I met someone new, I would ask for their Instagram or some equivalent. Friend groups form <c href="#" data-tip="Probably within the first one or two weeks">extremely quickly</c>, and it’s much harder to meet people even if there was an initial connection.</p>
								<p>The material is nicely packed into the camp, but it’s possible to find on your own. It merely serves as a platform for bringing people with similar interests together. Everyone here went through the same filter–<c href="#" data-tip="It had better not be a Wiener filter. Those things gave me nightmares">what filter, we don’t know</c>, but it brought a bunch of interesting people from around the world into one place.</p>
								<p>I found that making friends there wasn’t too difficult. I believe that people don’t actually judge you for things, and if they do, that’s not the right group of people to hang out with. If you make eye contact, smile, and wave at people, they’ll remember you at some point, and boom, a friend is made!</p>
								
								<h3 id="Lesson_3">3. Be kind, especially when you don’t know what’s going on.</h3>
								<p>I first saw this on someone’s Instagram about me. It’s from Everything Everywhere All at Once, and from a pivotal scene that <c href="#" data-tip="Probably because I left during a fight scene oops">I missed</c>. I don’t have a context to offer from the movie, but I was reminded of this quote during the first morning.</p>
								<p>I had spent the morning alone, which felt a little strange. Really, I was afraid of repeating the same mistake I had made two years ago at another summer camp, during which I had isolated myself from everyone. I felt super appreciative of <b>RA</b> and <b>MR</b>, who extended an invitation to stop by the FitRec. It probably didn’t take much for them to ask, but the gesture meant a lot to me.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Lesson_4">4. Caring about your work gets you 90% of the way there.</h3>
								<p>Our neuroscience professor was the 🐐. He’s so vibrant, hilarious, and genuinely cares about the subject. His passion was infectious. He could talk about anything and it would be interesting. Attaining knowledge isn’t the hardest part, because the knowledge itself is already out there. It’s getting to care about the knowledge and how it’s applied that’s difficult.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_5">5. Curiosity masks fear.</h3>
								<p>It’s surprisingly exhausting to go through two massive events in one day, but this was also evidence of growth for me–for the entirety of both, I wasn’t afraid to be myself. Before, I would isolate myself, merely listen to others, and probably shut down, but this time, I let myself have fun. I went in, curious about people’s backgrounds and what kind of people they’re like.</p>
								<p>Which reminds me of a piece of advice I heard, prompted by the question, “How do you start a conversation with a stranger?” It’s to approach the stranger with curiosity–there isn’t a motive in mind, no trying to get information out of them or a favor to ask. Just curiosity, and that’s enough to drive a conversation forward.</p>
								<p>Another example is when we conducted wet labs with crickets and worms. I despise bugs, especially the former–the unpredictability of crickets makes me uneasy, and I don’t enjoy the feeling of worms. But being in a lab setting sparked my curiosity, which overrode my phobia of bugs. Somehow, I was even deemed the cricket exterminator.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Lesson_6">6. If you don’t know who you are, see who you gravitate towards.</h3>
								<p>Sometimes, it’s easier to psychoanalyze others rather than yourself, maybe because evaluating others creates some distance. Biases that we hold so close to our identity can also prevent us from seeing ourselves as we are. The friends I got closest with reminded me of close friends at home: people who challenge me, people who must exhaust all resources and opportunities, people who don’t worry about fitting in. It was my way of seeking familiarity in the unfamiliar, and perhaps why I felt very little homesickness.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_7">7. Physics can be applied to biology???</h3>
								<p>Never would I have expected to see AP Physics C: E&M rise from the ashes, rewired in my memory as a relation between electrical circuits and a phospholipid bilayer and its ion channels. The battery is ATP; wires are the phospholipid bilayer; capacitors and resistors are ion channels. All this, coupled with Ohm’s law, inspire the Hodgkin–Huxley model, an amalgamation of conductance, gating variables, membrane potential, and “mysterious units.” Essentially, the model examines voltage dynamics across the membrane through a set of four differential equations. It was really, <i>really</i> cool.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_8">8. Become good at sprinting.</h3>
								<p>This skill is quite useful when 1. You’re running to shelter because of a torrent or 2. Trying to catch curfew. The second case happened to occur more often, and it was especially useful to be able to sprint up six floors in under three minutes. Imagine yourself in this scenario: It’s Fourth of July at the Charles River Esplanade, and you’re watching their fireworks show. You’re also someone who comes from a much smaller, quieter city. Notably, Boston is a much wealthier city than where you’re from. Granted, you’re going to want to optimize the amount of time watching the fireworks.</p>
								<p>And this place is quite far from the dorms, and so when a massive horde of people are also coming back from various places and are all trying to take the elevator to their floor (mind you, these elevators are also massively slow and have a maximum capacity of <c href="#" data-tip="We found that the actual maximum capacity was more like twelve. Fun fact: the elevators also broke extremely often. Take that as you will">eight</c> people), there’s going to be a traffic jam. Stairs become the only other option for making it to curfew on time.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_9">9. When there’s no risk of reputation, it’s easier to be yourself.</h3>
								<p>I first realized this on a spontaneous trip with <b>AD</b>, <b>StratfordJames</b>, and <b>ellipsis</b> to Newbury Street–I was free to be myself and could say whatever came to my mind.</p>
								<p>Part of the reason why I had trouble opening up in previous environments was because I already had a reputation–a feeling that there was a model I created that I had to fit in, this model being quite different from the way I am now. But I also realized that no one really holds models of other people in their mind. Essentially, I was fitting myself into a model that I thought other people held, when it’s really my creation.</p>
								<p>But with no reputation, I could start fresh, and it was easiest to be fully authentic. That led me to challenge my previous perception and ask, “Well, why can’t this be possible in a place where you do hold a reputation?” It’s the fear that other people will notice and point it out, but is that necessarily bad?</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_10">10. Portugese tarts and egg tarts are not the same.</h3>
								<p>They look almost exactly the same, except Portuguese tarts look like they’ve been torched a bit on the top. Egg tarts are much softer in consistency and are less sweet. Other than that, they’re quite similar–it’s interesting how the two were created independently, but they’re almost the same.</p>
								<p>Another fun fact: lactose free milk is just milk with a Lactaid in it! Not me thinking that the lactose was physically extracted from the milk before 😭</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_11">11. Always have at least one trusted person know where you are.</h3>
								<p>Okay nothing especially bad occurred, though there were a couple security issues that I won’t go into detail about. During one of them though, we basically walked through the area right before the threat arrived (or maybe the threat was already there and we didn’t know). So we were literally minutes or meters away from disaster.</p>
								<p>Not to scare people, but it’s generally a good idea to be expected by someone. It’s also a nice feeling to know someone is just a phone call away.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_12">12. Live through curiosity and doing things because they’re funny.</h3>
								<p>This is similar to a previous tip, except for an added element. Also, it doesn’t necessarily have to be based on fear. It’s merely a driver for new experiences. When there’s an option to stay with the mundane or try something new, sometimes I just think, “It would be funny” and <c href="#" data-tip="Of course like, don't be reckless and do things completely randomly. That's another issue">jump in</c>.</p>
								<p>What motivated this tip was an opportunity to provide a video testimonial for the program. I was interested, but what made me take the leap was a little “it would be funny” when I was thinking about the <c href="#" data-tip="Which was to show up on their site. But this isn't guaranteed, merely funny to think about">consequences</c>. It’s little things like that, that makes life interesting.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_13">13. Good matcha is not supposed to taste like grass!!!</h3>
								<p>My first matcha was at a Peet’s Coffee. Well, perhaps they’re only supposed to specialize in coffee, and I’ll also admit that my memory surrounding it was <c href="#" data-tip="Basically I was clumsy and spilled it on the school carpet. Also it was quite hot and I got slightly burnt with a pale green-colored milk. It was funny">funny</c>. But I am not a cow, and neither are you. Therefore, we should both avoid certain matchas.</p>
								<p>Perhaps it’s also the association that I form with matcha that makes it sweet. It was some matcha KitKats from H-mart, opened up on the staircase of the CDS. We (<b>CW</b>, <b>SL</b>, <b>CG</b>, <b>AD</b>, <b>SY</b>, <b>AC</b>, <b>EZ</b>) struggled over the Harvard CS50 course, but we were together.</p>
								<p>There are some places in Boston/near Boston that serve incredible matcha and matcha-flavored items, namely, Taiyaki NYC, Maiko Matcha, and Kyo Matcha. This revelation was quite similar to my exposure to what good tacos actually taste like. The first taco I ever had was at Taco Bell, and that alone should tell you enough.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_14">14. Overdosing on try not to laugh videos as a child gave me a good poker face.</h3>
								<p>Back in elementary school, I would binge Vines and try not to laugh compilations on YouTube because they were funny. I do regret the amount of time I spent on this, but the past is gone and written as is. I didn’t expect this to be useful later on.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_15">15. Have a friend who will challenge your ideas to its core.</h3>
								<p>And that’s how you’ll know whether you hold these ideas true to yourself, or whether you’re a vessel of other people’s ideas. I was quite surprised to see how much could come out from a simple “why” or “how,” uncovering deeper branches of thought, eventually reaching the axioms. Even then, those were challenged and <c href="#" data-tip="Neural plasticity!!!">modified</c>.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_16">16. Explore places to their limit.</h3>
								<p>We didn’t know when we would ever come to Boston again, or if we ever would. As a result, we exhausted as many places as we could go in <c href="#" data-tip="I was quite surprised as to how quickly I could learn a place's layout within a few weeks">Boston</c> and on campus. Whenever we were curious about a place, we always chose to go in if we could, because we didn’t want to hold regrets about not having gone to a place. We were crafting our own Marauder's Map: so many intricate, interesting places unlocked through the thousands of photos and videos on my camera roll.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_17">17. Find people who you’d call your foster family.</h3>
								<p>These people are a rarity. I found people who I could fully express myself around, and who would also challenge the ideas that I held so closely to my identity. These were people who I could also go on random, spontaneous adventures with–it could literally be the basement of a random building, and we could still find something interesting to do.</p>
								<p>Even though we came from very different backgrounds, I think what ultimately brought us together was a thirst for intellectual expansion. We did not let a place go unexplored the same way that we wouldn’t let a corner of our mind go unexplored.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_18">18. See people in different contexts.</h3>
								<p>One of my biggest fears is judging people too quickly and having them misrepresented in my mind because I’ve only seen them act under a certain context. It’s a fair assumption that a person would act similarly under other environments, but people are also more nuanced beyond some first impressions.</p>
								<p>So again, with that approach of curiosity, I like to see people in different contexts before making a judgment. I remember that someone said you can really tell what someone is really like if you go on a long walk with them. Walking is a repetitive activity, so talking is the only way to relieve boredom from repetitiveness. The second aspect is that walking can get tiring, which can activate how someone acts under stress. And even though this is a mild form of stress, it still tells a little about what someone is like.</p>
								<p>I think you can also tell what someone is like by watching them drive. It’s kind of similar to walking, but there’s sometimes instances where the driver has to act impulsively. Evaluating someone’s impulses is a way of reaching someone’s axioms.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_19">19. The difference between being ignored and loneliness is…</h3>
								<p>…that loneliness is not having anyone to ignore you.</p>
								<p>I don’t even remember how we got to this discussion, but they both feel the same. There’s an emptiness in the heart that feels like it can’t get replaced. It reminds me of a friend’s playlist that went, “when you lose something you can’t replace … now you’re just a stranger with all my secrets,” which plays into one of my biggest fears: losing people I deeply care about.</p>
								<p>Actually, I’m scared of a lot of things, like bugs, of falling, of the inevitable doom of our existence. But with losing people, I don’t know that I can rely on myself to keep it together. My track record says I can, but it doesn’t feel that way when it occurs. It feels like breaking <c href="#" data-tip="This metaphor makes sense only if you ignore the mechanism behind creating a horcrux">a horcrux you created</c>.</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_20">20. People typically don’t say things for the sake of politeness.</h3>
								<p>Sometimes, I disregard a compliment someone gives because I think that it’s said for the sake of being polite. The problem with thinking this way is that it discounts the scope of your achievement, and hence, messes greatly with self-esteem!</p>
								<p>Someone challenged my idea by asking me to imagine my thought process when I give other people compliments. I indeed don't give other people compliments for the sake of politeness. So why would I turn around and expect others to do that?</p>

								<h3 id="Lesson_21">21. We carry a bit of everyone in us.</h3>
								<p>For me, now I climb down the stairs two at a time, take piano breaks, actively try not to be <c href="#" data-tip="The equivalent of no thoughts, head empty">脑子空空</c>, am instinctively curious about people and things, push everything to its limit, and see things as they are. Some are new, others are more amplified.</p>
								<p>Alluding to <a href="https://mouffins.github.io/#Countdown">a poem I wrote a while ago</a>, it’s interesting to see what mannerisms friends pick up from you, because those are likely what make you stand out. They’re so influential that other people naturally pick up on it. But it’s also interesting to see what you pick up on, and also to bring these little mannerisms home. Because for me, I might not know how I’ve shifted from before versus after the camp, but other people would.</p>

								<p><i>A supplement to the next section, if you wish.</i></p>

								<p>Actually, the title of the blog post is a lie. Count 21 facts, yes, but the camp falls just short of 42 days–just short of the meaning of life. No, I didn’t expect this camp to answer all my existential crises, but it addressed a lot more of them than I expected. But there’s still a lot left undone, left unsaid.</p>
								<p>I still clearly remember the last lock I observed, all its pins falling into place as the key slid out. After that, the Mauraders (<b>StratfordJames</b>, <b>ellipsis</b>, and I) got their last ever boba from Boba Tea & Snow Ice House. As I cracked the straw through the plastic layer, its pop echoed. I heard the first pin fall.</p>
								<p>The next morning, it was still dark. We thrived at night. It would be the last night we spent together, because we were leaving in the afternoon. We looked at our colored lenses that we collected from the astronomy tower: <b>StratfordJames</b>'s red, <b>ellipsis</b>'s blue, and mine yellow. I never got to see what they looked like together. I visited <b>ellipsis</b>’s 天堂 with her one last time, in the bitter cold. Through the wind, I heard the second pin fall.</p>
								<p>Later that morning, I would step out of the Warren dorm for the last time. It was eerily empty, like the first week. Someone else would write their story here. It was a funny place–mostly funny things happened here. But it was still home. As I closed the door, my suitcase rolled over its sill, and I heard the third pin fall.</p>
								<p>Cut to the poster symposium, where they served some of the best food that we ever had in weeks. I was leaving immediately after, so there was no time for closure. Cut to leaving, which was a +1 count to the number of times cried this month. I took the green T with <b>ellipsis</b>, and it was zooming through the stops abnormally fast. The doors clicked shut, departing Park Street. The final pin fell.</p>
								<p>And as the plane took off to Phoenix, AZ, I watched the blurry red, blue, and yellow lights shake like glitter had come down from above. I wondered if I was dreaming, the key sliding out in the real world.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">Fruitless pursuit</h2>
								<h3>August 1, 2024</h3>
								<p>Every time I pass a stranger, I wonder about the stories left unopened. The can of fruit drops or the can of worms: in that brief moment, I merely learn about their smile or their lack thereof; the way they walk, the way they talk; a flash of how they might be feeling in that moment. Even if we don’t talk, their body language serves enough as an elevator pitch.  I don’t need much to be convinced that someone is interesting. Usually, I conclude that a new person seems nice, but an idea I was exposed to was that everyone can seem nice through first impressions because society conditions them to be that way.</p>
								<p>Which leads to the question, “How much can you know about someone you walk by?” This idea is a little similar to the one in my previous post, but here, it’s more that we know so little about each other. How many people do we actually know? As in, how many people can we predict exactly how they’re going to react to a situation? Or maybe how they’re feeling or what they’re thinking about at a given moment? At least for me, I can’t say that I know many people on a deeper level, and perhaps this is normal. The process of knowing someone is like trying to pass a drug through the <c href="#" data-tip="Can you tell that my brain is plagued by neuroscience stuff recently?">blood-brain barrier</c>. To figure out a dynamic between two people, coordinating meetups, and straight-up luck is a delicate balance. With a drug, too, it’s a delicate balance. The molecule has to be very small, yet it has to be nonpolar. However, the molecule probably isn’t small, because we would’ve found it by now. So the slightly larger molecules that are being researched not only have more combinations, but there’s also a smaller chance that they can pass through.</p>
								<p>To open up a case study, I introduce the neuroscience professor from camp. He’s a very interesting guy–as a starter, here are some of my favorite out of context quotes from him:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>“Every time I feed my cats at night, I say to them in a loving voice, ‘I’m gonna kick you off the balcony’ and they just think that I’m awesome.”</p>
									<p>”Fun fact: goats eat these mushrooms on purpose. It’s really funny when they pass out … I don’t know if they see like… goat God.”</p>
									<p>”So the downfall of our society is from pop science, and some people really should not have podcast equipment … we can’t just start taking podcast equipment and start telling people to take ice baths.”</p>
									<p>”The next time that someone says MSG is bad for you, you can tell them that they’re being influenced by racism.”</p>
									<p>“Cause I’ve got a gene that makes me susceptible to in-grown toenails. That’s what 23 and me says. Should I go get CRISPR to remove that gene?”</p>
									<p>“Smells like A sharp.”</p>	
									<p>”I could never touch that. That’s your body saying, ‘dumba—, that blueberry marshmallow vodka almost killed you.’”</p>
									<p>”I have a colorblind friend, and every year on his birthday, I send him one of those cards with different colors that says ‘I hate colorblind people’ and he can’t read it.”</p>
									<p>”That’s preventing you guys from your muscles falling apart and you guys turning into meat soup.”</p>
									<p>“They really like bald people, like they really love bald people to get EEGs.”</p>
									<p>“I love voles.”</p>
									<p>“If anyone says that they don’t care about the biology, off with their kneecaps.”</p>
									<p>“So you really like your skeleton, right? Imagine I came in and yanked out your bones. You would be soupy.”</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Was this also an excuse to document some out of context quotes? Absolutely.</p>
								<p>The point is, as many quotes as there are, it's extremely difficult to distill what kind of person he is, at least for the general reader. But for me, it's easy to fall into the benefit of the doubt and assume everyone has good intentions.</p>
								<p>I addressed the idea of not completely vibing with a person even if you have a lot in common with them in a previous post. And in fact, I thought about how truly good people in the world might be scarce. In particular, a friend picked apart one of my friendships so hard that I started realizing that "Hmm, maybe the friendship—or whatever it is—isn't so healthy after all." It was especially funny when other friends started agreeing.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6nNqaIlz87dR60U4g4jTqS?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">But then you went ahead and did what everyone said you’d do</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Now I’m ashamed to call my friends how do I tell them the truth</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">...</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Now I’m stuck in this position</p>

									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">‘Cause I do not want to taint my perfect image of you</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">But it’s time that I stop running and I face all the proof</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>In <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> (spoiler warning), resources become so scarce from the war that one of the main characters, Setsuko, sucks on marbles to trick herself into thinking that she still had Sakuma drops. The fact that I can hallucinate a friendship as easily as Setsuko hallucinates having fruit drops haunts me. How can I say that anything is real, if I can't even identify what is fake?</p>
								<p>And so the scary part about trusting another person is that they could just become a stranger who holds your secrets in an instant. That's why people are so fascinating to me. Pessimistic old me would not agree with this at all—I would see myself as the stranger.</p>
								<p>If I were to run into my past self in an elevator, what would I think? I don't know for now, but I do know that all the mistakes I made weren't a fruitless pursuit.</p>

								<h3>July 27, 2024</h3>
								<p>How well can you know someone in four weeks?</p>
								<p>The answer to this question depends on a lot of factors, but it’s surprisingly easy if you strike a chord just right with someone else. For some people at camp, I know them better than some friends I’ve known for a few years.</p>
								<p>Depending on your perspective on loss of control, this fact can either be heartbreaking or relieving. On the one hand, it’s sad that even if you have so much in common with someone else and you have a lot of opportunities to hang out with them, you still might fail to build a strong connection just because of some random, set parameter. You can do your best, but it still might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe you did your best, and everything else is irrelevant. Sure, it might not work out in the end, but it wouldn’t be your fault. If anything, maybe it’s good that it didn’t work out. Putting resources and energy into someone and having nothing come out of it is exhausting after a while, and it’s not worth getting caught in the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
								<p>A year and a half ago, I made a video titled, <c href="#" data-tip="It's not public anymore, so if you were trying to stalk it, I'd recommend stalking Fantastic Sky instead ;)">“How to talk to people (from a seasoned introvert).”</c> At the time, I was heavily isolated from other people but was actively aware of this. I was slowly beginning to realize that building connections with other people was somehow going to be important to me later on, but I wasn’t sure why. As <c href="#" data-tip="Once again, I cite the fact that I unironically scored 97% introvert on the 16 personalities test.">a heavily seasoned introvert</c>, it was painful trying to figure out who to open up to.</p>
								<p>Actually, I had made a huge mistake in this process. In around the same time frame, I wrote a poem that vaguely encapsulates how that time was:</p>
								<blockquote><b>Willow</b>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“​​It’s the time you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important”</p>
									<p>from The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
									
									
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Am I who I am or just anyone?</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Do not lie to me</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Do not waste my time and yours too</p>
									<p>For our wounds will open up again, deeper than before</p>
									
									<p>For a while, we danced in the rain, but now, it is only one and another daydreaming for the sun to shine again</p>
									
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Somebody told me that liars lie because that’s their job</p>
									<p>So why should you believe anything I say, if you call me a liar?</p>
									
									<p>I watched your blinking, fading green light, and then I realized that we carry a little of everybody in us</p>
									
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">A beautiful melody, now a distant memory</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0;">It was reverence and radiance</p>
									<p>Folly and fraud</p>
									
									<p>And so today the tears fell aside a storm fueled by the wind, unheard by the one that they were for.</p>
									
									</blockquote>

								<p>One of the most helpful pieces of advice I’ve ever gotten that brought me out of extreme isolation is to be curious about people. In an interaction with someone else, there doesn’t have to be a goal. You don’t necessarily have to gain something out of them. Merely trying to figure out how someone else’s mind works is enough. As one of my friends at camp said, it’s about how to “pick someone else’s brain apart” and to figure out how they see the world.</p>
								<p>The second variable in the equation is chance encounter. During the first half of the camp, I made an effort to go out on as many excursions with as many different people as possible. But in the end, the two people I got closest with are those who I met entirely from chance–no effort required. One was from a luncheon event, in which the tables were grouped by last name. The other was the roommate of another person at the luncheon. I want to stress how random this is, because there were other people at the luncheon, other groups at breakfast, and other random factors that I didn’t list. So why?</p>
								<p>I predict that leaving is going to be the most painful part, because meeting these people again is very likely going to depend on another chance factor. We might go to the same college. We might run into each other at a different event. We might never see each other again.</p>
								<p>One of my biggest fears is losing the people I care about, and the latter point above isn’t exactly comforting. But I guess that's the way things go.</p>
								<p>I try not to count down the last two weeks. A lot can happen then. Ironically, I’m realizing that returning home could be what triggers my homesickness. </p>
								<p>14 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes before I’m forced to face it all at the terminal. In everything I’ve built up in 6 weeks, how quickly can that fall apart?</p>

								<h3>July 16, 2024</h3>
								<p>My <c href="#" data-tip="If I were really rigorous, this is technically my second time visiting the east coast, but I was so little the first time (Florida) that I don't remember any of it. I can either revise to say 'north eastern' (which doesn't sound as cool) or to say that Florida doesn't exist.">first time visiting the east coast</c> has converted me to a staunch “east coast best coast” supporter. For those who know me, this may come to be surprising. As someone who comes from the west coast, I was in support of the “west coast best coast” mantra. Even my first Instagram post was captioned “west coast best coast 🤩”, accompanied by pictures from a biology camp in Alameda, CA. Little did I know that two years later, I’d return to the field from the other side.</p>
								<p>A rough April resulted in little option for choosing the trajectory of my summer, but the silver lining was that I could visit Boston, a dream I didn’t even realize was mine. Reno is tiny, often referred to as “the biggest little city in the world,” but Boston is rich in population, history,  and opportunity. It’s even relatively safe, has somewhat decent <c href="#" data-tip="The existence of public transportation in the US is remarkable.

I did so much research on the latter that my mom asked, “So are you here for the camp or for the food?”</p>
								<p>Well, the <c href="#" data-tip="'Little' as in one--I was going to write a blog post about this period but it's still a thought I have to marinate more in.">little option</c> didn’t seem so bad after all.</p>
								<p>I was scared of repeating what happened two years ago at the Rosetta Institute of Biomedical Research. For one, I didn’t document very much about the camp itself. The only place in which I documented was my old blog, but even then, it was more about work, the philosophical, and <c href="#" data-tip="Maybe Mom was right...">food</c>.</p>
								<p>The more nagging problem was I had trouble making friends. There were about ten camp members, except it was also heavily divided between guys and girls, so there weren’t many people to talk to. You’d think that it would be really easy to get to know everyone given the conditions, but this was the time that I consistently identified myself as 97% introverted. I didn’t really talk to anyone, but it was nice of the girls to still take me around to random places. However, it felt super isolated, and I pretty much have no connections to any of the people I met there. Work was a stronger part of my summer than the camp itself.</p>
								<p>And also, through one of the only pieces of reflection I did, I wrote the following:</p>
								<blockquote>"We did nothing for two hours, and we were really confused as to why we were being held up. At some point, someone asked if we could leave, and apparently we could?? :thinking: So I just... left. That was it. It felt super weird because there was no closure. I think it's because I didn't make the most of the experience."</blockquote>
								<p>But I quickly realized that fearing that things would go wrong is a not-so-fun way of entering a new environment. So what if things went right?</p>
								<p>Turns out that finding friends at RISE was really easy. When wondering why it was much easier, I initially pointed at how I became more <c href="#" data-tip="Waving and smiling to random people helped tremendously, and also having the mindset of 'well the other person also has to put in the work'">extroverted</c>, but I also think that this group of people have a similar mindset of wanting to find friends and wanting to be there. All of us are curious about the material, curious about the city of Boston.</p>
								<p>At a place I’d like to call a haven, I still find myself looking for the missing piece: the feeling of home.</p>
								<p>I found myself gravitating towards certain people. This seems to be a natural thing that occurs, and by week two, it seems like friend groups are established. I can see why a friend mentioned that it’s harder to join a new group, because it’s the feeling of being an outsider. But I also think that it’s possible to join any group even if you have weaker ties. What matters is how open the group is, and this requires some <c href="#" data-tip="The irony that this is at a science camp is not missed.">experimentation</c>.</p>
								<p>It’s also interesting to see what kind of people I’ve gravitated towards. Some remind me of my past self. Some remind me of friends. Some remind me of people I’d like to model myself after. With every person I’ve gotten closer to, I can plot them near another person I know on a multidimensional graph of traits. In a place of unfamiliarity, I chase the familiar to adapt.</p>
								<p>Maybe it’s why I get sad every time I visit a close friend. I haven’t felt homesick so far, but I also spend so much time being around people that I must mask any form of sadness. In those solo walks back to the dorm, I can’t run from reality anymore. Can’t pull up my computer to do work. Can’t listen to music or a podcast, since it’s for the sake of being alert while walking in the dark. It’s just raw thoughts running rampant.</p>
								<p>If there’s only one thing that I can take away from the camp, it’s the people. Struggling over labs, complaining about the heat, touring notable places in Boston. It’s purely by chance that I’ve met these people, and it’s possible that I’ll never see them again. There’s also something about meeting people who have no connection to your past. For me, I feel no consequence for being fully authentic or for spilling my past, because it’s not like anyone can do any harm. As a result, it’s even easier to get close with people because they get me for who I am.</p>
								<p>My hope is that slowly, I’ll bring this authenticity back home. At this new place, I’ve been chasing for pieces of home. Instead, I’ve found the missing piece of myself.</p>

								<h3>June 14, 2024</h3>
								<p>Around a week ago, our family came back from a trip from France and Switzerland! We’re just recovering from jet lag and legs gone noodle-ly. Both countries held strong impressions in our minds, but I’ll address France first.</p>
								<p>France is a necessary place to visit. It has landmarks that <c href="#" data-tip="Unless you’re willing to settle for an Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas or a LEGO Notre-Dame set">aren’t anywhere else</c>, and it has a lot of interesting people and situations. Maybe it’s because we didn’t have any knowledge of French beyond <c href="#" data-tip="Not even 'oui oui.'' I only learned that 'oui' meant 'yes' after the first few days">“bonjour,”</c> or because we were obvious tourists–after all, one of us had a comically large backpack with two equally comically large water bottles on the side, another would record anything and everything, and I wore an oversized Ocean Conservatory raincoat that had a flappy pocket that was dangling by a thread.</p>
								<p>Some parts of our trip were whee. Others… they do tell a story.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="#The_Ticket_Shop_Jump"><i>The Ticket Shop</i></a></p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="#Landmarks_and_Food_Jump"><i>Landmarks and Food</i></a></p>
								<p><a href="#We_got_pickpocketed_Jump"><i>We got pickpocketed</i></a></p>
								<h3 class="major" id="The_Ticket_Shop_Jump">The Ticket Shop</h3>
								<p>Our first barrier with not knowing the language was attempting to buy RER B train tickets from the ticket shop. Immediately, the line became a 30 minute wait, because everybody from the SFO flight was attempting to buy tickets to go elsewhere. When it came to our turn, we learned that to ride the metro, rather than a ticketbook that someone would check off, we would get a card that had the tickets loaded. But the guy didn’t really speak English, nor did we really speak French, so it took us a while to get everything we needed.</p>
								<p>In general, we noticed that there often weren’t people behind the service desks. Locals would use the machines, so tourists did too–it was the <c href="#" data-tip="These machines were also notably questionable. At one of the stations, out of the four machines that were available, only one was working. But even with this one, we witnessed locals getting their card rejected multiple times for no reason">only service available</c>. When any confusion arose, there wasn’t someone nearby to ask other than the people in the line. For the service that was available, <a href="https://c.tenor.com/JhW20a8VybAAAAAC/tenor.gif">one guy would point to another guy, who would point to another guy, this guy being the only one who knows English, who would point you to a service desk</a> that, upon arrival, was closed.</p>
								<p>Beyond the ticket shop though, using public transportation was easy to learn, if you know where you want to go. In Paris, there were fourteen metros and multiple RER lines, which would unlock access to the entire city. It’s not terribly difficult to visit notable landmarks if you’re close to a metro line, because transfers are also loaded with signs.</p>

								<p>Gotta go basic with the favorites: the Eiffel Tower and Palace of Versailles. We were fortunately met with good weather on these days, and these landmarks can’t be found anywhere else. The Eiffel Tower was a great view, and so was the view while in the tower.</p>

								<p>The Palace of Versailles was larger than we could’ve imagined. We took the entire day just to tour it. Not only was the inside massive, but there were endless fountains, gardens, and little structures to see. We did have trouble finding some of the places, like the Petit Trianon, but there were so many other places within The Place that gave us a general idea of the palace.</p>
								<p>I would recommend going to the palace as early as possible, because it does get crowded. We booked the first slot and immediately headed to the Hall of Mirrors before the people flocked there. Later on, it was impossible to get photos of the place without blocking someone. The exterior of the palace is large enough anyway, so it can wait.</p>
								<p>One of the fountains, Neptune Fountain, was renowned for its scheduled program at the end of the day. We missed its smaller shows <c href="#" data-tip="When we initially settled down near the fountain, it immediately set off. I was worried that there weren't any more mini shows down the line, so I started recording as I was sprinting. You could see me take the cap off and all the sand rushing by. Clearly makes for very aesthetic footage">multiple times</c>, but the grand show was pretty funny in comparison. While the smaller shows were programmed, the large show was just all the fountains turned on with maximum pressure, supplemented with loud music. It is something to experience, just was overhyped.</p>
								<p>We weren’t super lucky with the weather this time around, and a lot of places had construction around because of the Paris 2024 Olympics. I will warn that while the public transportation is decent, walking isn’t very accessible and isn’t the most tourist-friendly. We got confused about where to go multiple times, because the signs only had French. To be fair, that isn’t their fault, but accessibility is definitely a problem. Most of the metro stations only had stairs, so if you’re like my dad, who has <c href="#" data-tip="Basically, a lot of uric acid builds up and it causes swelling in the joints, which causes a lot of pain">gout</c>, it’s not going to be a fun time.</p>
								<p>I did mention that the public transportation was decent, but note that the trains get delayed somewhat frequently (we might’ve just been unlucky with this). One time, the train to Cannes la bocca arrived, but we sat in it for two hours before it moved. There were, supposedly, announcements, but they were in French. Some people even started leaving the train.</p>
								<p>As for Cannes La Bocca, there were legitimately no helpful signs, nor was there a service desk. The trains also did not come very frequently, and it was getting dark. Cannes La Bocca is a somewhat quieter place, so we decided to take a 40 minute walk to Cannes so that we could at least get help if we needed it.</p>
								<p>Despite the challenges, we still had fun sometimes! The food was amazing, although I will say that there aren’t a lot of vegetarian/vegan options unless you’re willing to eat like a rabbit. There was also a lot of Asian food. We probably had more Asian food than French food.</p>
								
								<h3 class="major" id="We_got_pickpocketed_Jump">We got pickpocketed</h3>
								<p>On the RER B line from the Charles de Gaulle Airport back to Paris, I already got a bad omen. We would be spending approximately the next hour and a half to visit the Eiffel Tower a second time, this time at night. One of my dreams was to see the Eiffel Tower glitter, because we probably wouldn’t be going back to Paris ever again. There were so many other places to go. But we would likely miss the tower glitter anyhow, because it only shimmered every hour, and we weren’t making it by 10pm. And we certainly weren’t staying to 11pm, because the last RER B ride back to the airport was at 11:30.</p>
								<p>And then we had a transfer.</p>
								<p>Metro line 6.</p>
								<p>Denfert Rochereau station.</p>
								<p>We missed a ride by thirty seconds, but it didn’t matter. Another one would come in two minutes.</p>
								<p>The station was eerily quiet after two minutes, especially for one that connected to Trocadéro, which had a full view of the tower. As we got onto the cart, suddenly, a flood of girls, all looking the same–sleek brown hair, brushed neatly into a ponytail or a bun, well-dressed and pretty–gushed into the same entrance. They screamed, “Don’t push, don’t push,” but they separated our family. The tram doors clicked. They were about to close, but we made it in time.</p>
								<p>We made it in time! But oh, that was just the start. The cart was incredibly crowded, and the girls wouldn’t budge. Surely, there wasn’t more space in the cart? I wonder if I could inch that way–</p>
								<p>“Why are you touching me? You reached into–” I look up. Who..?</p>
								<p>“YOU ARE GOING TO BE ARRESTED.”</p>
								<p>It’s my dad. He’s normally quiet, either on WeChat, tending the lawn and flowers outside, or rambling about Chinese politics at the dinner table. Now, his eyes are bugged out, locked in, towering over one of the girls, screaming.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“What’s going on?”</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“Your husband is crazy!”</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“Stop it, stop!”</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“You’re going to get into a lot of trouble!”</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">“He’s being a pedophile!”</p>
								<p>“STOP!”</p>
								<p>At the next station, they get off. My dad still glares. My mom and I stare at him, begging for answers. For a moment, I see a stranger in my dad's skin.</p>
								<p>“Did you see that?” His eyes dart around the cart, meeting silent stares. “She reached her hand down my jacket! They were trying to steal from me!”</p>
								<p>And then it clicks. This entire thing was planned. First, they separated the family. Then, they squeeze us in, but what they’re doing is feeling for bulges in bags or hidden pockets. And then, they cause commotion. The audacity to call my dad a pedophile, after they’re the ones who violate his personal space.</p>
								<p>My natural response? I burst into tears, but it’s useless. If there’s another group, they’d only target us. Sabotage the weakest link.</p>
								<p>The Eiffel Tower shone that night, but all that glitters is not gold.</p>
								<p>And honestly, I’m surprised this didn’t happen earlier. It was <c href="#" data-tip="Well not really, but it was supposed to be. Funny story, our plane home had a malfunctioning panel that caused the flight to cancel. So another day... nice">our last day</c> in Paris. Pickpocket stories are fairly common. Before the trip, my dad watched endless videos about pickpockets and told us about them. We believed him, but we never thought that it would happen to us. Surely, those videos were clickbait? How common is a pickpocket, really? There were police watching in Paris, right?</p>
								<p>We were just… lucky in so many ways, looking back. First, they <c href="#" data-tip="Maybe they did, but it wouldn't have been important at least">didn’t steal any of our belongings</c>. Both my parent’s backpacks were unzipped afterwards. Second, they didn’t steal from me, and arguably, I was the easiest to steal from. I was wearing pants with shallow pockets, and my phone could’ve easily been snatched. And third, this happened on the last day. If it had happened earlier, we would’ve been paranoid the entire trip, but now, we get a look on both sides–the beauty and beast within.</p>
								<p>We suspect that we were the target of another pickpocketing incident on the same day. Earlier that day, we were boarding another metro. My dad, on the other side, was about to get on, but a lady suddenly shouts and runs out of the cart, pushing him aside as the doors were closing. He got clipped on the door–body in, backpack out. But a kind man helped us out, shoved the doors open by just a crack, enough for my dad to squeeze in. These doors are no joke–they’re preprogrammed, so they’re impossible to open after they close. That camera, and possibly him, would’ve been gone had he not gotten himself in completely.</p>
								<p>This story isn’t meant to scare, but it’s merely a warning. Paris, like any other major tourist area, is over glorified. It’s pretty in pictures, but with good things also come bad things. These are all necessary things to see.</p>
								<p>I’ll sortie on out now. Onwards, to more good times!</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">For the love of Gaga Ball</h2>
								<h4>Ga! Ga! Go!</h4>
								<h3>May 8, 2024</h3>
								<p>Not only is the name <c href="#" data-tip="As it is reminiscent of Lady Gaga">iconic</c>, but this game is one of the only sports games that I would willingly play. With other sports, I see the game as merely kicking or hitting a ball to some designated area. Now, Gaga Ball is the literal epitome of a game that is about “merely kicking or hitting a ball to some designated area,” but for some reason, that’s not relevant.</p>
								<p>The game goes as follows. Everyone enters an arena-style pit, and a dodge ball is thrown in the middle while the players remain at the edge of the pit. After the ball bounces <c href="#" data-tip="GA! GA! GO!">three times</c>, the ball is in free play. Anyone can hit the ball with their hands. The catch is that one must avoid the ball touching below one’s knees. If such a tragedy occurs, the player is out of the game.</p>
								<p>There are other rules, such as no player may make two consecutive hits to the ball (the wall counting as a person, except the wall is allowed to hit the ball as many times as it desires), nor can the ball be hit out of the pit. Though if the ball is hit out of the pit, if someone from the outside catches it, they are allowed to re-enter the game.</p>
								<p>The adrenaline that comes from the game is simply unmatched. Part of the game comes from studying people and their strategy–whether they play offensive or defensive, and proceeding to avoid all the people who play offense. Also, because the court is so small, you’re always moving, studying, readjusting, moving, studying, readjusting… what I love about the game is how <c href="#" data-tip="Like some stock markets!">fast-paced it is</c> and how it tests your skill to adapt.</p>
								<p>We played this game at SNJ, which is a camp that takes people into the wilderness–though the most recent time I went, it was mostly going on rope courses because we were only there for a weekend. Lowkey I was having a kinda hard time around that weekend, but SNJ was like a catharsis. I got to experience the joy of being outdoors again with people from our school that I don’t talk to as often. They reminded me about what I should be grateful for! Like wow, family is such a big deal. While there are definitely flaws within my family, my family is good, and remarkably good, especially compared to some… other situations I’ve heard.</p>
								<p>Anyhow, I just wanted to nerd out a little on Gaga Ball, because this idea was somewhat old. It brought me back to some really good times.</p>

								<h4>No, this isn't about the 2008 financial crisis</h4>
								<h3>April 13, 2024</h3>
								<p>We’ve reached <c href="#" data-tip="This number will update, so if you know me personally and agree, let me know!">three</c> on the counter for people who’ve told me that I’m vulnerable on this blog, which is really interesting to me because I don’t think I’m being very vulnerable at all. Yes, these thoughts are pretty raw, so I could see that. But if anything, I don’t really open up about my struggles written here with friends. Some of my friends do read these posts, and would probably know more about my struggles from here than from in-person or online interactions. I don’t know why, but I <c href="#" data-tip="The thought process goes, 'I am living a privileged life, and therefore, I should not complain about the very good life I have.'">feel a pressing guilt</c> whenever I complain. It feels inherently wrong, like I don’t deserve to experience frustration, even though this isn’t true. Generally, I don’t like complaining unless it’s a shared complaint with the person I’m talking to or if it’s to the point that I physically cannot take it anymore. Even with the latter, usually the vent ends with one of the following: “It’ll be fine,” “I’ll cope,” or “Eh, I’ve got it.”</p>
								<p>The strange part is I don’t mind if people around me complain; I just don’t like myself doing it. If anything, I would feel terrible if I knew I could’ve helped someone by letting them vent to me.</p>
								<p><c href="#" data-tip="A made up term, loosely defined as the situation in which one avoids complaining">Complaint-avoidance</c> isn’t a bad thing, but it’s a double-edged sword, as it calls to the half-full, half-empty glass idea. Seeing a half-full glass is fine and dandy until you’re disillusioning yourself into seeing a glass full when there isn’t even a drop in it.</p>
								<p>And that’s when the bubble bursts. Or when the beaker breaks, <c href="#" data-tip="But bubble sounds nicer... maybe glass bubbles?">to align with the glass analogy</c>. To repress the moments in which one cannot take it anymore, or to gaslight oneself into thinking that things are fine. I think the main purpose of this post is to show people who know me maybe more on the surface-level that what I portray on the outside is absolutely not indicative that I’m on top of things all the time. There are times that I break. Yet, there’s this expectation I have out of myself that I have to somehow <c href="#" data-tip="'Do it for my homegrown's (sisters, brothers) / Do it for the clan'">stay strong for everyone else for some reason</c>, which could perpetuate the image that “I’m on top of things all the time.”</p>
								<p>It’s funny I say all this and still perceive some friends who have everything together, even though that’s not realistic and places them on a pedestal rather than as a friend.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">Half-empty, half-full glass</h2>
								<h3>March 30, 2024</h3>
								<p>What is the meaning of life? My take is that life is about learning how to be happy sustainably. Not about being happy, necessarily, but learning how to be. In learning how to be happy, that doesn’t mean to be happy all the time, because things happen. Happiness is also a metric that is measured differently depending on the person. Like personally, I really <i>really</i> hate bugs, but someone else could derive their happiness from studying bugs their whole life! The fact that we all have our passions and hobbies is so cool.</p>
								<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s head back to the definition. I haven’t explained “sustainably,” yet it is a crucial part of the definition. There are many ways one can be happy in a way that is disingenuine or that masks a root cause of unhappiness, rendering the happiness temporary. However, the boundary between what is sustainable versus what is unsustainable is a gray area too. Happiness naturally waxes and wanes, so is there ever sustained happiness? How long does happiness have to last for a certain technique to be deemed “sustainable”?</p>
								<p>I think the metric of what is sustainable also depends on the person. For me, sustainability is also about its repeatability and its after-effects, along with whether the overall action <c href="#" data-tip="Why is this starting to sound like Effective Altruism... this was not the goal">results in a net positive</c>. We shouldn’t feel taxed in the long-term to make up for the short-term either, and of course we shouldn’t create our happiness at the cost of others. Hence, I like to look at life through a half-full glass. We know so little about each other’s lives and intentions, so it doesn’t make sense to impose a bias behind someone’s actions.</p>
								<p>Of course, there are times when this half-full glass view of life was problematic. It is slightly reminiscent of toxic positivity. Indeed, there have been times when I looked past people who… well, may not have had the best intentions. This is when I kinda depend on my friends to see the situation at face value. An example of this is not of a person, but of an unscheduled <c href="#" data-tip="There's this security system at our school for when there's an active shooter on campus, and what happens is that all the doors automatically lock, including this massive garage door that normally never closes. Then a looped audio of our school's security guy plays, telling everyone to hide in a corner. It's meant to be pretty scary.">drill</c> during finals week around two years ago: when everyone else was panicking, I assumed that there was a drill and tried to convince others that this was the case. At the time, no one knew whether the drill was real, but I was living peacefully, which in retrospect, was naive.</p>
								<p>Otherwise, seeing life through a half-full glass has worked pretty well. I like to think that when we look around, everyone and everything is a reflection of ourselves. People will mirror your energy, which is why some people say that “life is what you make it to be.” We shape the people who are around us, and we mimic the people who are around us.</p>
								<p>Happiness is a choice we can make, and we all have it in us to push through and make that choice, no matter how hard it may be.</p>

								<h4>(if you aren’t afraid of them)</h4>
								<h3>March 25, 2024</h3>
								<p><i>First post with these <c href="#" data-tip="You found me!">fun comment things</c>, wheee!</i></p>
								<p>One of the first ways I introduced myself here was how I used to score 97% introvert on the 16 Personalities test. While I still consistently test as INTJ-T (Architect), I score around <c href="#" data-tip="That is, a 60%... which is supposed to be good.">a D- on the introvert scale</c> now. You might think, “Oh, scoring an A+ on the introvert scale? Well, surely there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert!” Scoring an A+ on the introvert scale is literally a diagnosis for <c href="#" data-tip="Not that there's anything wrong with being a hermit, of course. Hermit crabs are cool.">a hermit</c>.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
									Allow me to enlighten you with what life was like as an A+ introvert through snippets of my journal:
								</p>
								<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
									<ol>
										<li>“When we were introducing ourselves, my heart was beating so fast when the person before me was going, and now my lips are uncontrollably shaking unless if I force a smile.” -7/28/22</li>
										<li>“It’s too bad that I didn’t talk to him very much or catch up with him and I probably will never see him again so here I am with a nice existential crisis [about how I could’ve simply said hi], but oh well.” -1/10/23</li>
										<li>“At the end, [the instructor] made the two quietest people on each team to make our points, and I was one of them because. Oops. I don’t really talk.” -8/28/23</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>Anytime there was some sort of event that involved people I wasn’t familiar with, I didn’t want to go. In eighth grade and most of freshman year, I didn’t really talk to anyone new. I always talked to the same people–not that talking to old friends is bad or anything, but the underlying problem was staying in my comfort zone, during which I wasn’t happy anyway.</p>
								<p>Looking back, <c href="#" data-tip="There is probably a better term for this, but I define 'introvertism' as the practice of being an extreme introvert.">introvertism</c> was the cause of many of my problems. One of the problems was making friends/socializing with unfamiliar people, which requires practice. But introvertism inherently results in intentionally avoiding people to not talk to them because of the fear that this new environment would turn around and judge us. Laugh at us. But this was all in my head because <c href="#" data-tip="Sure, there are exceptions, but if someone truly judges/laughs at you, then they have showed you who they are. Also, worrying about the judgement/laughter is your own voice. You worry about judgement/laughter from yourself, not necessarily that of others.">no one actually does that</c>. And not talking to people would only enhance this fear, because I never built up the skills to talk to people, which led to nitpicky comparisons and lost opportunities.</p>
								<p>It’s not just about lost opportunities. Talking to people builds up the ability to… judge? Interrogate? Conjecture? All those words are <c href="#" data-tip="Not me just talking about how people don't inherently judge/laugh at others like, three lines ago?? But this is more of... a protective thing?">too strong</c>, but the idea here is that talking to people allows us to better gauge who someone is. And, well. Speaking from personal experience, that is pretty important.</p>
								<p>One of the lessons that I wish I thought about more earlier is people are not out to get you. This may be feeding into a naive view of always looking at the glass half-full, but this could also be from self-love and the belief that you are already worthy of surrounding yourself with good people. I believe that most people genuinely wish the best for others, and are willing to help. I found that I became happier the more I talked to people. I also don’t judge myself as I did before, and carry myself with just a little more authenticity and confidence. There’s no way of winning in overthinking. With overthinking, there’s this “heads I win, tails you lose” mentality. I still remember talking to people online at first, who are good friends now. The caret blinks, expecting my words to flow, but it waits and stares back at me. With every keystroke, I worry that the sentences won’t come out right, or that they weren’t clever enough. But why mask who I was to start if people were going to find out who I was anyway? The only way is to just write.</p>
								<p>That is not to say that I have no fear in talking to new people or that I’m a newfound extrovert. But there’s a little comfort in knowing that merely existing is okay and good enough, and that <c href="#" data-tip="That's the title of this post!!!">people are cool if you aren’t afraid of them</c>. If there was one thing that I could tell myself, it would be that she’s already good enough and doesn’t need to prove herself to anyone. The fear of not being good enough wasn’t an effective method to push her into being better, and instead, it restricted her in what she could’ve been. Alternatively, I wouldn’t have told her anything. Talking to people was something she had to find out for herself.</p>

							<article id="Happy_Pi_Day">
								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">Happy π Day!</h2>
								<h3>March 14, 2024</h3>
								<p>At the time of writing this, if we combine the month, day, and hour, we get 3/14/15 → 3.1415 ≈ π. Unfortunately, we are merely in the year 2024 (we got 68 more years until ‘92!), and there are only 60, not 65, minutes in an hour, so we can’t go much further with this pi representation.</p>
								<p>But we can go further with spirit! Specifically, I had the honor of leading Pi Day at my school, which was, of course, much more difficult than I predicted. To be fair, this was the first event I ever led at our school, and there were only four members in our committee for a school-wide event. For a comparison, committees are typically six to seven people.</p>
								<p>A lot of the time, life felt like the bridge that was built under a poor approximation of pi (ok I could not actually find this story, so maybe it’s imaginary). Initially, I was pretty critical about how I ran the event and wasn’t happy with how it went, but a lot of people said it was good, which I was confused about. I can’t help but immediately think, “Oh, these people are just being polite. Of course they can’t say that it <i>wasn't</i> run well.” But it also feels wrong to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwUEPryqmw">reject the compliment right away</a>. At least when I give a compliment, I’m not just trying to be polite, so why would I assume that about others?</p>
								<p>Anyways, this post wasn’t supposed to get so philosophical so quickly. Our team brainstormed and ran a few new events, while also retaining some traditional Pi Day events. Knowing that there were previous events that this year's event could be compared to was nervewracking for me. At some point during my first class, I had a moment in which I could feel something sharp in my chest if I breathed too deeply. The cardiovascular system or whatever was triggering that… she was working a bit overtime! There were multiple past 12am-ers and many journal entries screaming “AAAAAAA,” but things worked out in the end. I could focus on the mistakes, but that would probably be boring to read and are nit-picky anyways. All the mistakes funnily worked out too, so… yay?</p>
								<p>Another interesting point was that someone said that I sounded really confident when public speaking, which challenged my perception because that’s not a trait I associate myself with. I wouldn’t say that I’m confident (yet), but I would say that I’m good at forcing myself to do something when it has to be done. The confidence came out because I had no other option. It was like a survival response.</p>
								<p>Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from this (and I realize this is probably super obvious, which I learned after running the event) is that being a leader isn’t only about how hardworking you are. It’s also about how well you communicate and coordinate with other people. There is no way to be in five different places at once. If there was, I absolutely would have done that, but unfortunately, I am not an exception to physics. The people I have to thank the most are the people who helped out with the event <s>as they helped balance out my incompetence at times</s>. All the people who did science demos, pie deliverers, pie distributors, the setup and cleanup crew, staff, the Pi Day committee, and of course, the student body for their unwavering patience.</p>
								<p>I did not get to enjoy a piece of pie like in previous years, but I did get to experience a new slice of life!</p>

							<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">Privilege</h2>
							<h3>January 25, 2024</h3>
							<p>Walking into Los Angeles, I knew that there would be economically polarized sectors throughout the city. I saw the glamor of Hollywood, Berkeley Hills, and universities in LA, along with the destitution in less fortunate communities. But I had only seen both in videos, not in real life. I read about Little Tokyo, and how you should stay clear from 3rd Avenue and beyond, though that was on Reddit. And who believes Reddit anyways?</p>
							<p>I walked carefree through San Pedro Street with the intention of getting to the Fashion District, passing 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, then 3rd Avenue. The streets were getting dirtier, and there were more wanderers as I continued walking. 4th, 5th, 6th: the buildings were run down, and there were people shouting slurs to no one. Flies, the stench of urine, and catcalls filled the air. I never expected to run into this section of LA.</p>
							<p>Walking in that neighborhood in LA was pretty necessary for me. I experienced sympathy for these people, but never understood what it was like to fear every second of your life. I had the privilege of being an outsider and perhaps worse, of ignorance.</p>
							<p>I cried a good amount in the shower that day, not sure whether it was of happiness or sadness. It wasn’t really either, but maybe it doesn’t matter. I realized that a lot of those people are waiting for a change that may never be delivered. A lot of people don’t even know what they're waiting for, or that they’re waiting. They can’t walk out easily like I did, because I had the security of returning to a home. I must remember these people as I nestle in the comfortable nooks of the very coat that I wore that same day.</p>
							<p>I wonder if this polarization is inevitable in big cities. Is it human nature to keep striving forward, forgetting the ones who lie on the sidelines? I wonder if this will get worse through the advancement of AI, because a lot of people are going to get laid off. Even for someone with defined dreams, they don’t always work out because of social, political, or economical factors that they have no control over.</p>
							<p>California officials are clearing out the homeless now. But where do they go?</p>

							<h3>December 31, 2023</h3>
							<p><i>…and with that, the 2023 season comes to an end!</i></p>
							<p>At the start of this year, I said that I would be a more confident person. That is a pretty vague goal, and I thought that a lot of what I wrote still applied. But I watched a video of myself explaining a math problem from around a year or two ago and… it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I had wanted to watch this video for a while but could predict my pain before even opening the link. I’m not sure if my somewhat-positive perception is because I’ve grown to be more accepting of myself, or because the video itself really was not that bad–though the use of filler words and randomly chuckling from nervousness every five seconds was not it.</p>
							<p>But I’d say that in general, I’m more confident in talking to more people! I think part of this was because I was half-forced to, and also because more of my classes this year have been a different mix of people. Also, being more involved in different positions plus teaching more has also helped a ton. Now my challenge is how to come up with something to say quickly, because a lot of the time, I sit there in silence, trying to formulate the perfect thought to say, but the wave of conversation has already passed. Improv classes were supposed to help, except when I stopped taking them, I kinda made teaching more formulaic. I prefer predictability, which is easier to do with teaching–not so much with conversation.</p>
							<p>We'll leave that up to 2024 me.</p>

							<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
								<ol>
									<li>Deciding against getting a premium account on Spotify for at least three times within the last month alone because the price was not justifiable enough to categorize it as a non-compulsive purchase (all in hopes of not disappointing the financial literacy teacher :”) ).</li>
									<li>I decided to wait out on buying a NYT subscription for some reason, and procrastinated on it for so long that someone else actually figured out that inputting our school email gives us a subscribed account for free. On a similar note, I also procrastinated on purchasing jewelry-making tools and yarn, and I ended up getting the former as a Thanksgiving present, and the latter as a Christmas present, both of which were from the same friend!</li>
									<li>Learned how to ice skate! My fall rate reduced from 17 falls/hr to 6 falls/hr, and somehow this is the most I’ve been injured??</li>
									<li>Passed 100,000 words in my journal! To be fair, the journal was made a year and a half ago, but still. Once my fingers start flying, they won’t stop.</li>

							<h3>December 21, 2023</h3>
							<p>Welcome! If you’re here from Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), you’ve come to the right place for my posts! If you’re not, I originally had my blog on AoPS, but have migrated here because I wanted to try branching out to my own website. This isn’t technically my own site (as in my own domain), but this site feels a lot more customized than on the AoPS interface. I still have a few things I would like to work on:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>This might be picky of me, but the muffin logo on the index page… it is not as centered as I would like it to be. I don’t know why it won’t move up, but honestly, the muffin is probably the least urgent of what I want to work on. It would be nicer if it was bigger and moved up a bit.</li>
								<li>The subscribe form is currently an embedded Google form, but I would like to have a subscribe form built into the site.</li>
								<li>Interactives! I really want to code games and other bits into the site just so things are a bit more interesting. Maybe like a randomized Mad Libs, etc.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>plus more things as they come up.</p>
							<p>On the topic of what I’ll probably be learning in 2024, I learned a lot this year and a lot has changed. Namely, apparently I’m not as much of an introvert that I used to be? I used to get 97% or higher percentages on the introverted end unironically, but now I’m a bit more even. I definitely do enjoy being around people a lot more than I used to and feel more fulfilled from talking to people. I still kinda self-deprecate myself over the smallest of interactions or the smallest of anything, which I’m still working on not doing as much.</p>
							<p>On a related note, I’ve also learned that no one is obligated to do anything for you, nor are you obligated to do anything for anyone. I find that the former is much more important to realize than the latter, because it made me a lot less dependent on external validation. I used to overthink over a lot more interactions just because someone didn’t react in the exact way I expected them to. And apparently–somehow I only just realized this–people didn’t react at all to what I was saying because I simply don’t speak loudly or enunciate my words clearly enough. I can hear myself just fine, but obviously, the outsider perspective is very different. I’ve been told by a lot of people that I have a softer, whispery voice, which used to not be true. So perhaps I shall tune into a loudspeaker. The latter (that I’m not obligated to do anything for others) is important too, but I didn’t find the need to exercise that belief very much.</p>
							<p>I also have been more accepting of letting go of whatever is out of my control. There have been so many instances in which something didn’t work out the way that I wanted it to, but later, it was good that the particular event didn’t work out. If it had worked out, in the long term, it would’ve fallen apart because it was 1. Not the right timing, as in I wasn’t prepared for it and 2. It’s not the last time I get that opportunity anyway, so why be upset. I should actually be comforted about how life works out even if it doesn’t align with the plan that I have. After all, life would be super boring if I knew the entire plot.</p>
							<p>So for 2024, we’ll all have a mind map of what we want to do! But let us not be too surprised if we stray off our path, for that was meant to happen. Whatever is meant for you will come to you. Isn’t the thought of that comforting?</p>
