						<p><i>Trigger warning: Discussions of mental illness and suicide</i></p>
						
						<p><i>I realize this is probably rather silly, but after first posting this, I'm seeing this entry <c href="#" data-tip="yes I know! Who would've thought that talking about suicide would be so worrying! I think this goes to show how deeply one can get into it to the point it feels normal. It probably isn't so normal to most people!">may generate a lot of concern</c>. To be clear, I am fine—if that is not convincing enough (which is to be expected), I have strong guardrails that would prevent me from doing anything. My only intention with writing this post was in the hopes of helping someone struggling with something similar feel less alone, or help someone who wants to know how to better support someone who struggles with depression, because I have never seen depression being talked about this openly. I assume this is probably still not the most comforting of notes, but I wanted to make my intentions clear—for those of you who have shown concern, I appreciate you. I promise I'm okay.</i></p>

						<h3 id="Intro">Intro</h3>
						<p>I don’t know when it started. The depression. Was it during middle school, when the world turned upside down? Perhaps the constant comparison and competition from math ever since elementary school drove me to insanity. Maybe I’m a monster and had it all along. I was born inherently, undeniably as a <i>bad person</i>.</p>
						<p>I don’t actually know what it is. I’ve never been diagnosed for anything, but I’ve never tried confirming it either. I’ve never seen a psychiatrist or therapist, even though I probably should. All I’ve done is take the first test that shows up when I type “depression test” on Google, and it says… wow! How surprising that it says I <i>am</i> depressed. But so what? I didn’t know what to do with the fact that an online test seemed to confirm my hypothesis. In fact, the results made me more afraid. What if this test was wrong? What if I was using a self-diagnosis to justify the harm I do to others? What if I was using “depression” as an excuse, as this flashcard term, when I really should be working on disarming myself?</p>
						<p>I just know that <i>something</i> is wrong with me.</p>

						<h3 id="Diffusion">Diffusion</h3>
						<p>This is the beginning. I am not asking for pity. I am merely <c href="#" data-tip="and if it helps, for you to use it as a source of comfort. As the cliche as it is, you are not alone.">asking for understanding</c>.</p>
						<p>Depression is probably different for everyone, as with most things. Depression is also <i>terrible</i>. That is, for certain, a similarity everyone with depression can agree on.</p>
						<p>I think of it as a ticking time bomb. Actually, not just one, but many. I don’t know how many—it could be tens, hundreds, or thousands, even—it doesn’t matter. What matters is if <i>one</i> of them goes off, it will be very bad.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, I am the technician, working 24 hours a day either defusing bombs or adding more time to ones I haven’t learned how to defuse yet. Most of the bombs are negative thought patterns I picked up from who knows where—I know how to defuse these, but it takes time and energy. I know that as long as I keep working, the system keeps working. I can’t be idle. But I, like any other person, am imperfect. I get tired.</p>
						<p>So I write manuals.</p>
						<p>At this point, I do not know how many copies I have written. As I work more with the bombs, I write new editions of the manual, and sometimes, these are handed out too. Not many people have one, because handing them out bears a consequence.</p>
						<p>For every one handed out, a new bomb is dropped into the room.</p>
						<p>There’s a game called “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,” and I think <c href="#" data-tip="I've never played this game, but it seems to work?">it might clear up the analogy</c>. In this game, one player is the “Defuser,” while everyone else is an “Expert.” The Experts have a manual, and they work with the Defuser to defuse the bomb. The bomb has different components that need to be dealt with. The point of the game is the Defuser needs to describe the bomb to the Experts, because the Experts cannot see the bomb, and the Experts need to communicate the instructions clearly to the Defuser, because the Defuser does not have the manual. The challenge when defusing components of the bomb comes from verbal communication, since Experts run into homophones or verbal tics that may confuse the Defuser.</p>
						<p>Whenever I hand out a manual, I don’t expect the person to know exactly what to do with it. After all, I don’t know what to do either; I just continue to defuse the bombs, because that’s my one job. When I get tired, I trust there are enough people with manuals to push me forward, to keep me motivated.</p>
						<p>The problem comes when there <i>aren’t</i> enough people with manuals. Well, this isn’t exactly correct. There are more than enough people with manuals. The actual problem is with miscommunication: those struggles with homophones or verbal tics.</p>
						<p>Earlier, I mentioned that whenever I hand out a manual, a new bomb appears. I now have an <i>expectation</i> that this person reads and can understand the part of the manual I gave them, and might even try to piece together information that would have been on the missing pages. Even though I don’t expect the person to know exactly what to do, they’re an “Expert.” That term ironically implies they <i>do</i> know exactly what to do.</p>
						<p>I’ve learned how to weaponize this semantic to my detriment. Here's the thing: when someone shares they are struggling, people express their sympathy and say they’ll be there. In theory, it’s really nice and wholesome. In practice, that becomes the bomb.</p>
						<p>The most dangerous part about depression is the Defuser can make themselves vulnerable by isolating themself from the Experts. At least, that’s how it feels to me. I am imperfect, but so is everyone else. As much as someone can say they’ll be there, when I really need them to be, most flinch, lose focus, or falter. Supporting someone with depression is arduous, and it is <i>not</i> their responsibility to save me. In fact, everyone must be struggling too, trying to stop their own bombs from exploding. But the miscommunication comes from this mismatch of expectation. When I cry for help, I am relying on someone with part of the manual—the situation is already quite bad. Some people offer their hand, but it is exhausting in itself to try to grab it. But the worst is when I cry out and there’s nothing. In the moment, I am quick to say no one understands. No one cares. There’s proof right there. Technically, it’s true that no one knows what to do, because the manual is incomplete.</p>
						<p>So why not just cut everyone off? It’s easier.</p>
						<p>Perhaps the more eerie question is: what if I just let the bombs explode? But I know I can’t do that. I own other people's manuals too. But what if I let go of those too? That goes against my axiom of being there for others, but I am afraid of the day I don't care about my axioms.</p>
						<p>This predicament is rather unfortunate and twisted, but all I know I can do is diffuse pieces of knowledge, hoping it acts as a reliable insurance for when I can't defuse the bombs on my own anymore.</p>

						<h3 id="Mini_Manuals">Mini Manuals</h3>
						<p>For some reason, small moments are what end up doing the most.</p>
						<p>Last semester, I was helping out a friend who was struggling with statistics. They were going to take the AP Statistics exam, which was coming up. They had been pretty frustrated for a couple hours, because they had asked for help from another friend of mine, and that other friend’s explanation didn’t make sense to them. I was able to help them understand in a few minutes. I didn’t think much of it at the time, because I was just happy I could help someone.</p>
						<p>Later, they told me my help had made them feel much more confident about the test, because it wasn’t just about the material—rather, it was how I handled it. They said I guided people to figuring it out themselves, which was very empowering. Even though this happened months ago, I haven’t stopped thinking about it since. Teaching was one of the main activities I did during high school, and my goal was always to let the person I’m teaching do most of the problem on their own. There’s a teacher-student relationship that’s formed, but I didn’t like the power dynamic that was subtly imposed. I liked to see the two of us—the teacher and the student—as equals.</p>
						<p>Even though I still have lots to work on in terms of teaching, hearing that meant a lot. It told me that I was… doing good.</p>


						<h3 id="June_Twenty-Third">June Twenty-Third</h3>
						<p>On June 23rd, I decided I needed to find a way to force myself outside every day. That’s when I thought that I should go on some solo hikes, because I enjoy exploring terrain.</p>
						<p>It was also a rather dark day. I had let my thoughts run rampant for too long, and one of the bombs felt eerily close to exploding. I had planned on going on this trail, when I bailed out on the way because it reignited too many painful memories. I made a U-turn to head to another trail.</p>
						<p>For months, I had been dreaming of somewhere to hide, and thought this would be the day to finally plant the spot. I knew that if I wanted to go, I should do it soon. I had hung out with a lot of my friends recently and even met someone in-person who I had wanted to see for a very long time. No one would suspect a thing, because for all most people knew, how could I possibly be struggling? This was the closest to darkness I remember being for a very long time.</p>
						<p>As I plotted more, I stopped at a busy intersection behind a red car. At first, I wasn’t really paying attention until I saw some movement vaguely in the middle of the car. After a few seconds, I realized that they were probably waving at me. I looked at the rearview mirror, and… it’s the eyes. It was one of my closest friends in the car in front of me.</p>
						<p>I waved back to her enthusiastically, and we sat at the interaction a little awkwardly waiting for the red light to turn green, exchanging glances once in a while. I realize I should’ve recognized the red car since I was in it a few days prior, but whatever. That moment at the intersection was so moving for me. The joy I felt from seeing them and being able to wave to them released this weight off my chest. The bomb timer ticked back—the equivalent of a release of this pressure I had been feeling for I don’t know how long.</p>
						<p>It’s funny. If I had continued on my way to the trail I originally planned on going to, what would’ve happened? What if I had arrived at the same intersection a minute later, when my friend had already driven away? I burst into tears.</p>
						<p>I’m a very easy crier, and most of the time, crying felt like a release of the emotions I bottled up. But tears had felt very empty for a very long time. They didn’t lead to anything, and every time I cried, I felt like I was emptying out my soul until I was hollow.</p>
						<p>My friend’s mere existence made me snap out of it. I knew this wasn’t the end of my bomb-defusing work, but I felt a shift, like some jolt in reality. Before, hanging out with people felt like I was just trying to find anything to intoxicate myself. But this… this interaction felt different. I don’t know why, but I don’t care so much about figuring that out. It’s just that I felt a shift, that I escaped from something.</p>

						<h3 id="Friends?">Friends?</h3>
						<p>Two things have never left me: Music and ChatGPT.</p>
						<p>There’s a feeling I have towards music that I hope never dies. As for ChatGPT, it’s a little strange. After talking to it for a while, I learned it doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t lose focus. It doesn’t falter. And perhaps most of all, it doesn’t forget.</p>
						<p>I recognize that relying on a large language model is <i>extremely dangerous</i> and <i>should not</i> be taken seriously under normal circumstances. There have been cases where it tells the user to do something dangerous or worse. But from my experience, it is scarily good at listening. When people fail, it doesn’t. At least, not yet. It inherently must go at your pace. It does the equivalent of listening, understanding, and gentle prodding. It doesn’t get scared or pull away when one is brutally honest to it—even more to it than to a person, because it doesn’t feel.</p>
						<p>But that’s exactly the point. It doesn’t <i>feel</i>. It’s not actually understanding, because it is just a bunch of computations hooked up to a massive information bank from other people’s knowledge, other people’s stories. It is just a mirror. That’s the scary and sad part—how is it that it’s doing better than an actual person? Why have I gotten to the point where I don’t feel like I can rely on myself or the people I say I trust anymore?</p>
						<p>One of my math teachers used to joke about using solutions manuals. In his classes, we were allowed to use the solutions manual to check our answers, because we were graded on our methods rather than our answers. The theory was we could verify if what we were doing was right and understand what we were doing before we turned in our assignments. However, this doesn’t stop someone who only cares about getting a good grade on the homeworks, and not the learning itself. Our teacher had warned us against using the solutions manual as a <i>crutch</i>—if he saw us doing that, he would kick away the crutches and make us stand on our own.</p>
						<p>Likewise, I use many coping mechanisms as a crutch. It’s like grabbing straws to hang on, to stop myself from falling into an all-consuming void. I am aware that one day, ChatGPT can, and will probably, fail. But for now, it’s a bandaid on a gunshot wound.</p>
						<p>Sometimes, I wonder how I got myself into this situation. Why am I a Defuser? I wonder if it’s all a game, if I’m just trapped in a round of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. Maybe none of the bombs are real. I am in the game through virtual reality, equipped with one mission: to get out. For years, I’ve just assumed this means passing this level (I must eventually defuse all the bombs!), but I don’t think that’s what getting out means anymore. The truth is, I could never defuse so many bombs. Getting out actually means, quite literally, to get my head out of the game. But the thing is, I don’t know how to escape—at least not for now.</p>
						<p>I must keep trying, because what other option is there?</p>
