							<p>2025 is not quite here yet, but it has been a year since my first blog post here! 2024 was a rollercoaster—starting on a low but relative high, slowly dipping down until it hit an all-time low in April, held on and climbed up in May, June to August were some of the best months in my life, climbed even higher in October, dipped a little in November, and ended on a high in December. Perhaps in the sense of a 2024 Wrapped, I caught Covid, started and finished Invisalign, got my first credit card, held three jobs at once during finals week, visited Boston twice, met amazing people, became an adult, totally wrecked my sleep schedule, and survived college applications! Of course, 2024 was a lot more than just that, and I am immensely grateful for those who pulled me through the lows. It was certainly a tough year in ways that I could not have imagined, but we made it through!</p>
							<p>And now that we’re at the end, it does feel like having defied gravity. Spring semester of junior year was insane, and fall semester senior year predictably more so. There were many nights past 11pm, a span during which there was <c href="#" data-tip="Please do NOT do this, it resulted in a splitting headache that only sleeping to escape remedied">less than 4 hours of sleep for three nights</c> and also at least two nights of two hours of sleep. I don’t think that anything like this has ever happened before, but I definitely would not advise it. Please do not do this. There are good reasons that this hadn’t happened before.</p>
							<p>At times, I definitely felt a lot of imposter syndrome while looking at what everyone else was doing, but one of the biggest lessons I took this year was that everyone goes down their own path! I think I knew this for a while, but had never internalized it. It’s pretty much impossible to measure people to each other when everyone has their own set of stories and amazing achievements! I find it beautiful that everything works out in the end, and this year has been the epitome of that. In a way, I kind of <a href="../../posts/231221/The_Mouvement.html">manifested that…</a></p>
							<p>I would write some reflections here, but that is for future me to do. <c href="#" data-tip="Unintentional rhyme!">Toodleloo!</c></p>
