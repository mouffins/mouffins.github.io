					<p>It’s Saturday morning, and everyone has already left for home. The dorm hall where I live is eerily empty; normally, it’s quiet from people sleeping in on the weekend, but this time, the silence is hollow. Though my flight home is in a few hours, part of me doesn’t want to leave.</p>
					<p>I strolled around campus on this quiet Saturday, wondering what home means. I thought I had it figured out, but having two extended places of stay stretched across two coasts made me realize that the definition of home isn’t so simple.</p>
					<p>I place home in the hearts of each person I meet, but when our paths diverge, I feel displaced.</p>
					<p>On days like these, I think of Skylight. It’s a place on the university campus next to the high school I attended. It’s not actually called that — just a hacker’s name for it, perfectly in East Campus style. The first — and realistically, probably also the only — time I went up there was with someone who I don’t speak to anymore.</p>

							<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Again I fall asleep</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp to see you in my dream</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>My alarm rings at 5am the next day. Soon, I’m walking on my own again. I can feel my insides churn and split apart; it feels <i>wrong</i> to go home, or at least the place I called home for eighteen years.</p>
					<p>When I’m in my hometown, I know I’ll feel like a foreigner. Two weeks is long enough for that to happen, yet also short enough to start readjusting my sense of home.</p>
					<p>And then, just like that, I’ll be gone again.</p>

					<p></p>

					<p>I’m at the airport, realizing how lonely life really is. There may be courses to follow or a pipeline to travel through, but I know I’m not the kind of person to follow someone else’s path to feel fulfilled. I think of the one college essay prompt: <i>“While some reach their goals following well-trodden paths, others blaze their own trails achieving the unexpected.”</i> Sometimes, I wish I wasn’t this way; there’s a sort of wicked pride I possess in being able to carve a way for myself. I remember last year, being so sure of the major I wanted to pursue and having solid connections. But after the whirlwind of senior spring term and this fall semester, I’m not sure I still could say the same.</p>
					<p>Would my past self have expected the path I took?</p>
					<p><i>But this path is what I want,</i> I keep telling myself. <i>The choice was, and still is, mine.</i></p>

					<blockquote>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0;">I whisper something you don't hear,</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp cause you weren’t here</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Maybe I’ll have to be okay with the fact that there will be places and people I deeply miss no matter where I go. In a way, it’s a strange privilege, because it means I at least have something to lose.</p>
