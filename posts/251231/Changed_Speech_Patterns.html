					<h3>December 31, 2025</h3>
					<p><i>by mouffins and bulgogi merchant</i></p>

					<p><b><i>Objective: explain changed speech patterns but we troll each other s<u>im</u>ultaneously</i></b></p>
					
					<div class="msg mouffins">This post is going to be quite different from usual, as you will see…</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">AAAAAAAAAAAAA</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins">We have a GUEST WRITER! Each guest writer who comes on has an alias associated with them. Please introduce yourself!</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Hello! I possess the moniker of Bulgog<u>i M</u>erchant. I sell many things, including beef, k<u>im</u>chi,</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins">HI CHI I’M MOUFFINS!</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">...and fungi. We’ll explain how I got my wares in a bit.</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins2">Wait, I think it would be good to explain it now, since you formally selected your n<u>am</u>e— OH NO—</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">HI E I’M BULGOG<u>I M</u>ERCHANT!</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins2">Hi erchant, I’m mouffins! Okay, this is already getting out of hand. I think we should explain it now.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Okay, are you going to explain it?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins2">No, I’m mouffins.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">...</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins3">...</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Okay, anyway, there are multiple specific strings of letters that we cannot say. It’s like that dad joke:
						<img src='../../images/Changed_Speech_Patterns/dad_joke.jpeg'>
					</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins3">Yep, it’s that s<u>im</u>ple— AHH OH SHOOT</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">:) HI PLE I’M BULGOBIGIGSDIOGDSG<u>I M</u>ERCHANT.</div>
					<p></p>
					<p><i>Sidenote: we were editing this blog post in a shared Google Doc; needless to say, it got a little chaotic.</i></p>
					<div class="msg mouffins3">Hm, I think you spelled bulgogi wrong. But anyhow, it’s that… easy. The rules are very easy. You just have to sustain a conversation without saying said strings of letters. It’s all a very silly… fun beaver-e.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Oh yes, the beaver! For context, the school we go to has a mascot n<u>am</u>ed...</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins3">HI ED</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">...the school backwards.
						<img src='../../images/Changed_Speech_Patterns/tim.jpeg'>
					</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins4">Oh, I thought we went to Clown College™. But anyhow, in avoiding certain strings of letters, this also means avoiding certain words, and unfortunately, there are a lot of words we must avoid.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">There are two strings of letters in the English version of the troll that we must avoid (see if you can find them all). But there are also other versions of the troll in different languages. For example, mouffins, what is tofu made of?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins4">They’re made of… beans! But I forgot what the beans were called.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Hmm.</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins4">Hmm.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Can you describe this picture for me?
						<img src='../../images/Changed_Speech_Patterns/shiba_inus.jpeg'>
					</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins4">Awwww, they’re so cute! I see two orange dogs. They’re just chilling. That’s it, right?</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">What are the orange dogs called?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins5">They’re… dogs?</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">What type of dogs?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins5">They’re orange!</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">...</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins5">Ummm… oh, I forgot what they were called. Speaking of animals, can you say “my cat” in Chinese? No measure words in between.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Wo de mao? Where’s the troll? Also, for readers who don’t know Chinese, the forbidden sequence is <u>“wo shi”</u>, (I’ll take the troll for the sanity of the readers) so if you say “t<u>wo shi</u>bas”, you can say “hi bas, I’m Bulgolg<u>i M</u>erchant”)</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins5">I’ll be nice and not troll you. By the way, since you were looking for the troll, here it is:

					</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">...</div>
					<div class="msg">(by the way, as we are writing this, mouffins is playing colordle. It turns out that different types of milk are colors! For example, almond milk, oat milk… what’s that other type of milk that’s made from beans?)</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins6">Oh hm, I feel like we’ve done this before, but I forgot! Speaking of beans… mmm, I feel like red bean would go really well with milk! Like, there’s banana milk, right? What about <i>red bean milk?</i></div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">Wait, that’s definitely a thing… doesn’t TeaDo in the Student Center serve a red bean milk?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins6">I think so! It’s quite yummy. You could almost say it’s so good that it’s the opposite of pressive… ugh, what was the word for that? I can’t recall.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">not pressive? unpressive? inpressive?</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins6">You're really close...</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">no i’m bulgog <u>i m</u>erchant</div>
					<div class="msg mouffins6">Oops, I forgot.</div>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">oHhOoOoOoO</div>
					<p></p>
					<p><i>We didn’t know how else to end the post, so this is how we chose to end it.</i></p>
					<div class="msg bulgogimerchant">(also mouffins wrote that last line and stole my identity >:( what was that word for it again?)</div>
