						<h4>9/16/25 → 3<sup>2</sup>/4<sup>2</sup>/5<sup>2</sup></h4>
						<p>I’m going crazy but it’s the happiest I’ve been for a very long time.</p>
						<p>This post will probably be the most disheveled one in a while, but it’s kind of fun to experiment with a different style. Also, I’m currently running on very low sleep, so maybe this decision is purely impulsive.</p>
						<p><u><i>Life update!</i></u> I’m getting settled into my classes, and I think I finally have a set schedule. During the first few days, I was trying to swap two of my classes, which turned out to be much more stressful than I expected. I didn’t get my first-choice <c href="#" data-tip="One of the requirements is to take HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences) classes, some of which are categorized as communication subjects (CI-H, CI-HW, or CI-M).">HASS</c> class initially, and I realized I didn’t actually like my second-choice so much. There weren’t that many other options, given they’re also typically filled, and on top of that, I had to somehow Tetris my classes around while simultaneously being uncertain for my other class.</p>
						<p>Luckily, I finally got the schedule I’m happy with, with leeway for one of my classes in case my load gets too unbearable.</p>
						<p>I’m currently thinking about majoring in course <c href="#" data-tip="Computation and Cognition">6-9</c>, and possibly double-majoring in course <c href="#" data-tip="either general or applied mathematics">18</c>. I already have a lot of my <c href="#" data-tip="General Institute Requirements—these include the communication requirements from HASS courses, but also courses in math, biology, physics, and chemistry. Currently, I need 8.02 (Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism) and 5.111 (Principles of Chemical Science), but I've been introduced to both during high school, which is why it's strategically better for me to take computer science classes, in which I have much less experience.">GIRs</c> out of the way, so I’m focusing on computer science classes this semester, since we’re on <c href="#" data-tip="Pass/No Record, meaning we get a P even when we'd get an A/B/C normally, and No Record otherwise, as if we never took the class.">P/NR</c>.</p>
						<p><u><i>6.1010 - Fundamentals of Programming:</i></u> This class has definitely been the most difficult one for me so far. I’ve already lost quite a bit of sleep from this class alone. I made the mistake of starting the first lab late-ish, which caused a lot of stress. I felt like I was in senior year spring semester again, except with classes I am very happy with taking.</p>
						<p><u><i>6.1210 - Introduction to Algorithms:</i></u> Initially, I was in 6.1200: Mathematics for Computer Science, which is the prerequisite for 6.1210. However, this is one of the last semesters where you can jump to 6.1210 without having the prerequisite. I haven’t done very much for this class so far, but I’m very nervous about this first pset, because I haven’t started it. I barely have proof-writing experience, but I’m hoping I can pick it up as I do the first couple psets.</p>
						<p><u><i>9.01 - Introduction to Neuroscience:</i></u> So far, it’s been pretty chill here! I got introduced to neuroscience in my later years of high school, so I wanted to try it out in college. I’ve been enjoying it, especially because I do appreciate a less intense class alongside the computer science ones.</p>
						<p><u><i>ES.9114 - Non-violence as a Way of Life:</i></u> I always love using this class as a lore-drop, because our classroom is at a prison facility. We had to do a background check, which for some reason required filling out a form for employment. On top of that, we’re taking UberXLs there. Anyhow, I was drawn to this class because of the small class-size, but ultimately because I wanted to change my perception on incarcerated people. Logically, I know the judicial system is screwed up, and there are way too many social problems which end up creating unfortunate, complex situations. Emotionally though, I feel a little intimidated by people in jail; I instinctively assume they must be a bad person, when in reality, they have their own stories and motivations for doing what they did, and are also worthy of forgiveness and compassion. I’m hoping that after this class, I won’t hold said instinctive assumption anymore.</p>
						<p><u><i>PE.0626 - Rifle:</i></u> This class is in direct irony to the previous one, and also pretty contrary to what I would normally do. I’m terrified of loud sounds and don’t like being in possession of something that could be lethal. However, that’s exactly why I chose this class. I’m chasing new experiences and pushing through what I never thought of doing before. In addition, I don’t think I’ll have many other opportunities to try this out.</p>
						<p><u><i>4.S21 - Architecture Studies:</i></u> I’m super hyped for this <c href="#" data-tip="Discoveries tend to be more low-commitment, while allowing you to get a taste of the subject.">discovery class</c>! Basically, it’s scheduled time to go into the makerspace and try one of the tools. I wanted to build things in college, but didn’t think I would make time for it myself. Taking this class forces me to have some time to actually think of what I want to make, and learn the skills I need to build them.</p>
						<p>In addition, I’m looking at clubs to join! Many of them are for my potential majors, but I also wanted to try out some fun ones.</p>
						<p><u><i>The Tech:</i></u> This group makes newspapers for the happenings of Cambridge, Boston, and more specifically, MIT. Originally, I wanted to be an MIT blogger, but I got rejected. However, admissions recommended I write in the Campus Life section of The Tech. We haven’t really started yet, but I’m excited to have a more formalized place for my writing and learn from people who edit my work!</p>
						<p><u><i>MIT-Wellesley Toons:</i></u> I’ve always enjoyed singing—in fact, I did choir in elementary school, but didn’t get to continue later on. However, I really wanted to join an acapella group in college: specifically, The Logs. However, I had absolutely zero experience, and was trying out just for the giggles. Turns out that I actually got into two, and I ended up joining The Toons! We haven’t met for a rehearsal yet, but again, I’m super hyped to learn from this group!</p>
						<p><u><i>AppDev:</i></u> I feel like I currently have a very CS-heavy load, so I want to do something with it. It’s kind of like what I did for this blog—actually, part of the motivation for starting the blog was to <c href="#" data-tip="Although it turns out that there isn't... that much coding I got out of it... but it was still fun!">keep up what I learned in my coding classes</c> junior year of high school. One of my friends is one of the executives of the club, which made it more hype! He designed a really cool site called MapIT, which has this beautiful design, but more importantly, it shows you exactly where a room is on campus. It was especially helpful for lost freshmen like me, so I wanted to be involved!</p>
						<p><u><i>Camp Kesem:</i></u> I don’t know if I’ll end up committing to this club, but members work on creating a summer camp for kids battling cancer. It’s really sweet, and I also want to have some outlet for teaching.</p>
						<p>That’s all for now!</p>
